When using the
UpdateBrowserDatabase.exe
utility to update SOLIDWORKS Toolbox in
SOLIDWORKS PDM vault manually
, you may receive the error “
Unable to backup destination database
” as shown below:
Unable to backup destination database
The unable to backup destination database error occurs if the
UpdateBrowserDatabase utility cannot delete the swbrowser.sldedbold
backup file.
When the
UpdateBrowserDatabase
utility runs an update, it removes the
swbrowser.sldedbold
file and replaces the file with the new backup.
To prevent this issue, clear the ‘
Read-only
” check box in the ‘
Properties
‘ dialog box for the
swbrowser.sldedbold
file.
