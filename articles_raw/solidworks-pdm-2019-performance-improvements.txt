SOLIDWORKS PDM Performance is always a concern for administrators.
Even small delays quickly compound when they affect multiple users, multiple times a day for repetitive actions.  On the other hand, when dealing with very large vaults with hundreds of users in particular, saving even a few seconds on processes that are repeated hundreds of times a day can mean a big win for an organization overall.
In SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019, working with large assemblies and especially files with complex reference structures is faster than ever before.
Large, complex lists in the “Contains” and “Where Used” tabs will display much more quickly than in previous releases
.
Large complex lists display faster in SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019
Additionally, many
file operations such as moving, dragging and dropping, re-naming and adding files are much faster
in SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019.
Even simply browsing through the vault, especially browsing into folders that contain a very large number of files that have already been locally cached (something that could significantly impact SOLIDWORKS PDM Performance previously) is much faster in this latest release.
How do you take advantage of these improvements?
To take advantage of the SOLIDWORKS PDM performance improvements, all that is necessary is to upgrade your SOLIDWORKS PDM installation to 2019.
