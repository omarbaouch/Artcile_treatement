About SOLIDWORKS PDM
SOLIDWORKS PDM
is a data management system that allows you to securely store your files on the network but work locally on your computer. All files are securely stored in a vault allowing you to share information only when it’s released, reducing costly errors from using non-approved files. SOLIDWORKS PDM is used to easily manage any file in a multi-user environment while tracking revisions and versions.
Data creation and file management have always gone hand in hand. As a large number of files get created, we rely on a safe and secure place to store them, while also making the data easily accessible to those who need it. PDM Professional makes file organization and storage easy. It’s no wonder DriveWorks and SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional have been the winning combination for design automation and file management for years.

The SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional integration utility lets you communicate with your PDM vault through DriveWorks doing a variety of tasks such as:
Store and manage DriveWorks Projects from inside the vault
Automatically check in any generated specification files including SOLIDWORKS assemblies and drawings
Drive Data Card values for files and folders
Drive SOLIDWORKS components that are saved in the vault
Integrate PDM serial numbers into your DriveWorks numbering scheme
How to configure the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional Integration Utility
