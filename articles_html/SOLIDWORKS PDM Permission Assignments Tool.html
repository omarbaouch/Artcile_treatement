<p>If you&#8217;ve had the honor of being named the local vault administrator then it&#8217;s extremely likely that someone has approached you regarding their SOLIDWORKS PDM Permission Assignments:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I need to be able to </em>&lt;Fill in the blank&gt;<em>, but I can&#8217;t.  </em>&lt;Random Name&gt;<em> can, but I&#8217;m not allowed.  Why is life so unfair?&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Previously as a vault administrator, it was a constant subject at my desk.  I would often be looking in the vault permissions, checking who had permission to do what and whether I needed to add a group to a folder permission of a new folder.  Within the Administration Tool, there&#8217;s a SOLIDWORKS PDM Permission Assignments tool that will allow you to quickly look at a vault folder, and see which groups have permissions assigned to it.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Folders</strong> &#8211; Lists the folders in the vault</li>
<li><strong>Groups with permissions</strong> &#8211; Lists the groups or users that have permissions for the selected folder</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows us to quickly see which groups have permissions assigned to a specific folder, without opening each group properties dialog separately.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Permission Assignments is also available at the User level via the Administration Tool, but as a general rule (outside of the admin user) we recommend only assigning permissions at the group level</p></blockquote>
