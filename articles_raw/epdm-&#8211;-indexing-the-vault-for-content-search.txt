When you index a vault archive, the search tool can use the content search option to search a document’s contents or properties.
The first step is to set-up the Enterprise PDM index server, on the SQL Server hosting the vault database. The SolidWorks Enterprise PDM Installation Guide (found in the \Support\Guides\<lang>
directory on the installation media) outlines how this is done.
The keys steps include:
Verifying the Microsoft Indexing Service installation
Updating the vault database with the index server name
Changing the database server login account
Changing the SQL Server login account
Adding index server filters
Rescanning the index catalog
Managing vault index catalogs.
Once this is done, the SolidWorks Enterprise PDM Administration Guide (available from the Help pull-down in SolidWorks Enterprise PDM Administration, or it can be found in the \Support\Guides\<lang>directory on the installation media). Describes how to
Index Vault Archives on a SQL Server
. It also describes how to
Configure the Index Service on a Non-SQL Server
and how to
Remove a Vault Index
.
