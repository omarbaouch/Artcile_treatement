This article is part of a series for troubleshooting common, and perhaps not so common, SOLIDWORKS PDM error messages.
SOLIDWORKS PDM ERROR:
“Could not create folder. Cause: The file/key name was invalid.”
This reported error can occur when executing a SOLIDWORKS PDM Template.
The error is caused when a folder/file name being defined in the SOLIDWORKS PDM Template contains an invalid character
. Later versions of SOLIDWORKS PDM will capture the invalid character, and prevent it from being used in the folder/file name
Invalid Character
If the Template was created in an earlier version of SOLIDWORKS PDM, an invalid character may exist in the folder/file name defined in the PDM Template. In this situation, a user will receive the message “Could not create folder. Cause: The file/key name was invalid.”  when executing the PDM Template. Editing the PDM Template and removing the invalid character will resolve this issue.
Invalid characters
for folder/file names include:
" (Double quote)

/ \ (Forward / Back slash)

: (Colon)

? (Question mark)

* (Asterisk)

< > (Smaller / Bigger than)

| (Pipe)

and any character created when pressing the CTRL key
This error message can also occur if the folder/file name is empty.
