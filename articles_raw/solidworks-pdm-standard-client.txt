The SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard Client, is the user portal for your vault. This portal provides users access to the files in your vault, with the ability to view or modify the files depending on user permissions. Users can interact with the vault through a Windows Explorer interface, or directly from within SOLIDWORKS software.
