<p>Before working for Javelin I was a Mechanical Designer creating mobile equipment, and assembly machinery using SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD software. I loved working with SOLIDWORKS but did not have the luxury of being able to use SOLIDWORKS PDM software for file management.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion I spent countless hours populating data over and over again, reattaching links to files that had been moved, and producing shop floor drawings of projects that I worked on in weeks past!</p>
<p>To show you how Using PDM with SOLIDWORKS can make life a lot easier we have created the following video:</p>
