<p>There can be a number of reasons for this message, some of which can be controlled by good Vault View management, others can indicate permissions issues, while other still can indicate problems with file(s).</p>
<p>In many cases this issue can be overcome by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy or save the file that can&#8217;t be saved outside the vault.</li>
<li>Do an <strong>Undo Check-out</strong> on the file<em> (you may need the help of your EPDM administrator for this step)</em></li>
<li>Check out the file.</li>
<li>Copy the file from Step 1 back into the vault overwriting the one you checked out.</li>
<li>Check-in the file.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should allow to check in the file without loosing all the work you have done since the last successful check-in.</p>
