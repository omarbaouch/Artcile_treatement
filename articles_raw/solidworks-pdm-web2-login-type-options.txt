When a user logs into a PDM vault online via
SOLIDWORKS PDM Web2
, many don’t realize there are potentially
two different license types
that can be chosen, either a
Web
license or a
Viewer
license.  The options can be chosen by clicking on the box below the Vault name.

What’s the difference between the two PDM Web2 License types?
Web license
:  If there is either a
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional CAD Editor & Web,
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional Contributor & Web
or
SOLIDWORKS PDM Processor Site License
available, then a user can log into Web2 using the
Web
option.  Using this login option will give users with appropriate permissions the ability to Check Out, Check In, Change State and Delete files.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Web License
Viewer license
:  If there is a
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional Viewer
or
SOLIDWORKS PDM Processor Site License
available, then a user can log into Web2 using the
Viewer
option.  When the user logs in with this option, they will only have “read only” access to the vault.  So no matter what permissions the user account may have, if the Viewer option is used, during that session they will not be able to make any changes in the vault.

Setting a default license type
In
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2019
, it is now possible to change the default login type through the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
.  Open the IIS Manager and go to the ‘SOLIDWORKSPDM’ site.  Double click on ‘Application Settings’ to edit the settings for the Web2 interface.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Application Settings
Go to the DefaultLicenseType setting.  By default it’s value is set to “Web”, meaning that users will have to click on the drop list and select
Viewer
if they want to log in using that type of license instead of a
Web
license.  By changing this vault to “Viewer”, then the login type will be Viewer, unless the users click on the drop list and select
Web
instead.
