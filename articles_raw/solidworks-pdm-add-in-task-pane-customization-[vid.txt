The File List area of the
SOLIDWORKS EPDM
Add-In provides lots of valuable information about the active file in SOLIDWORKS.  By default there are columns showing information such as “Workflow State”, “Checked Out By” and “Version” as well as “Revision” information.
But these columns can be customized to report any information that EPDM knows about the file, including any variables from the Data Cards.
