With ECO’s/ECN’s, consistency of data input can be ensured by populating the ECO’s/ECN’s with Variables (Custom Properties) entered through Data Cards. These ECO’s/ECN’s are often in the form of a Word or Excel documents. In this article we will look look at creating a link between a property in Excel to a data card variable.
This article will assume that the appropriate
Variable
has been configured for Excel xls and/or xlsx file types
and that the
Variable
has been mapped to the the data card.
If you are not familiar with how this done, please refer to the SolidWorks Enterprise PDM Administration Guide.
In Excel, select  a cell column or row, that will be linked to the
Custom Property
.
From the
Formula
tab, select
Define Name
.
Enter the
Name
and select whether the
Scope,
will be for a particular
Sheet, Sheets
or the
Workbook
From the menu bar select the
File
tab
Select
Info
and then
Advanced Properties
from the
Properties
pull-down
Click on the
Custom Tab
to add or select a custom property. Next select
Link to Content
and choose
Source Name
we defined earlier. Click
Add,
to create/define the
Custom Property
and
OK,
to exit
Properties
.
The Excel document can now be used as a template, so that information entered into the Data Card, will populate the appropriate cells.
Please refer to my blog article ‘
EPDM – Mapping Variables to Microsoft Office
‘ to see how this process can be applied to Microsoft Word.
