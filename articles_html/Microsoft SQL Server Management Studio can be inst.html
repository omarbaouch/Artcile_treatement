<p>SQL Management Studio (SSMS) ships with SQL Standard, which is what is in included with SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional, but not with SQL Express, which is included with PDM Standard.</p>
<p>SSMS can be installed for SQL Express though. The installation files are located with the SOLIDWORKS Installation media, in a folder called sqlmngmnt. SSMS can also be downloaded from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft</a>.</p>
