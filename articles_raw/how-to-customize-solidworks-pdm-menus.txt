It’s easy to customize SOLIDWORKS PDM menus to better suit the needs of a group or a user that is working in a PDM vault. An example of this is how the right-click shortcut menus and toolbars within the Vault View can be easily customized.
The Administrator can modify each of these elements of the interface by
right-clicking on the User or Group
that they want to customize the interface for, and selecting
Settings
, then go to the
Menus
screen.
PDM Settings
Here the Administrator can customize the “Background Right Click” menu, the “File Right Click” menu, the “Folder Right Click” menu, and the drop down menus for “Actions”, “Modify”, “Display” and “Tools”.
Customizable Menus
Removing commands from menus
For instance, the default File Right Click menu in the PDM Vault View includes a number of items, some of them unrelated to PDM operations, such as antivirus commands, third party programs, and in the case of sldprt, sldasm and slddrw file, the SOLIDWORKS flyout menu, which are not needed inside the PDM vault.
Standard Right Click
These can be removed by selecting the <Non-PDM commands> and clicking Remove Command
