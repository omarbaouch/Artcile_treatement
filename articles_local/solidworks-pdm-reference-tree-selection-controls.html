<p>Navigating large assembly reference trees within SOLIDWORKS PDM can be difficult, especially when Checking a file In/Out, performing a Copy Tree function, or Changing States.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the dialog box when checking out a file:</p>
<p><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_46601" style="width: 1116px"><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/check-out-assembly.png"><img alt="Check Out Assembly" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46601" height="772" src="/assets/images/check-out-assembly.png" title="" width="1106"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-46601"><noscript><img alt="Check Out Assembly" height="772" sizes="(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px" src="/assets/images/check-out-assembly.png" title="" width="1106"/></noscript></p></a> Check Out Assembly</div></p>
<p>When checking out a file, the dialog box above is the default dialog box that is seen, however, if I had wanted to select all of the references for one of the sub assemblies, I’d need to select them individually.</p>
<p>However, with a slight modification, all you will need to do is select one checkbox to select ALL of its referenced components…. See below:</p>
<p><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_46603" style="width: 1115px"><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/check-out-levels.png"><img alt="Check Out Dialog Box Commands" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46603" height="686" src="/assets/images/check-out-levels.png" title="" width="1105"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-46603"><noscript><img alt="Check Out Dialog Box Commands" height="686" sizes="(max-width: 1105px) 100vw, 1105px" src="/assets/images/check-out-levels.png" title="" width="1105"/></noscript></p></a> Check Out Dialog Box Commands</div></p>
<ul>
<li>The Show All Levels/Top Level Only dropdown above allows you to expand/collapse your reference tree in the dialog box</li>
<li>The <em>Show Reference Selection Controls </em>toggle turns on a parallel set of check boxes that will allow you to select or clear all check boxes from that one node. So if I only want to check out one sub-assembly and its parts from the Top level assembly, I can do so using the parallel check box. To access this toggle, Right click on any file listed and select ‘<em>Show Reference Selection Control</em>‘</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The same commands can be applied when the file is being checked out or used in the copy tree functionality.</p></blockquote>
