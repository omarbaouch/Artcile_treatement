I have all the appropriate folder and state permissions, and I can view and save a file via the history dialog, so why is the SOLIDWORKS PDM Get disabled?
SOLIDWORKS PDM Get Inoperable
This is due to a user setting within the vault; ‘
Always work with latest version of files
’.  Which forces the latest version to always be cached.
To remove this option;
Administration Tool
>
Users
>
[Username] Right-Click
>
Settings
SOLIDWORKS PDM Administration
Reference Dialog > ‘
Always work with latest version of file
‘
Clear this if you’d like to Get previous versions via the history dialog (Explorer > Select file > Right-click > History)
Always work with latest version of files
As the above image shows; there is an option ‘
Enable the get version command in SOLIDWORKS Add-in
‘ and with this enabled means that even with the setting ‘Always work with latest version of file’ on, we can Get a previous version via the add-in;
Get previous version through SOLIDWORKS Add-in
