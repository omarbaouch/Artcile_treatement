I recently came across this video created by DS SOLIDWORKS Senior Technical Manager Steve Fick.  Steve did a great job touching on two very important advantages of the
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional version over the standard version
to 1) ensure that a distributed and mobile team can access data quickly and reliably, and 2) having the ability to make good decisions while on the road.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional on a mobile device
PDM Web Portal
The key focus is on the
web portal available with SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
and how easy it is to navigate with a mobile phone as it automatically detects and switches to an optimized format.  It also
integrates seamlessly with the eDrawings IOS or Android app
which allows managers to review the actual CAD data while on the run.
Take a look at the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional mobile device demonstration below:
The nice thing about this web portal is that it doesn’t require any additional PDM licensing.  It consumes the same PDM licenses that designers and managers use while at their desks.  We have set up a good number of clients with this web portal already.
