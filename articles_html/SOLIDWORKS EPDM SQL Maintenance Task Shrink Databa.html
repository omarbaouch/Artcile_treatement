<p><strong>The Shrink Database task reduces the size of SQL Server database data and log files.</strong> This task can cause index fragmentation and is not recommended by SOLIDWORKS. SOLIDWORKS does note that &#8220;on large databases or environments with hundreds of users, shrinking the SOLIDWORKS® Enterprise PDM database once per year may improve overall performance.&#8221; Please refer to the Solidworks Knowledge base article S-067843 for more information. An active subscription is required in order to access the knowledgebase.</p>
<h4>Before running this task:</h4>
<ul>
<li>you should have good understanding of working with SQL databases</li>
<li>a recent back-up of the database and the archive</li>
<li>if possible, a test run on a non-production test vault that is mirror of your production vault</li>
<li>ensure that no is accessing the database during this operation</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps to run the Shrink task may vary between versions of SQL. These instructions are based on Microsoft SQL 2014. If you are using a different version of SQL, please refer to the SQL Help for instructions. In fact, even if you are using  Microsoft SQL 2014, I would still recommend reviewing SQL Help for recommendations and additional information, beyond what is covered in this article.</p>
<p>This task is launched by right clicking on the database you wish to shrink and selecting the task Shrink Database.</p>

<p>Ensure that the correct database is selected and click on OK to shrink the database. Depending on the size of the database, this may take a while. Running this task after hours is recommended.</p>

<p>Selecting the &#8216;Reorganize files before releasing unused space&#8230;&#8217;  option, will allow you to specify a target percentage.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, Shrink Database can cause fragmentation of the tables and may require rebuilding of  indexes. This option should be fully evaluated before its use.</p>
