In SOLIDWORKS PDM the
Administrative Permissions
“
Refuse login
” can be used to prevent a user or members of a group from logging into the vault. The user and its permissions settings are still active in the vault, but the user will not be able to login.
User Refuse Login
The “
Admin
” user is a special administrative account that cannot be locked out – even if “
Refuse login
” has been enabled for the user or group that “
Admin
” is member of. This is to ensure that at least one user can log in and administer the vault, should all other users be prevented from logging in.
