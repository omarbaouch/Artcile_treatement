In my

, we looked at Creating Branches from a Source file, so that we could test different concepts, on these Branches. In this article, we will look at how to combine these changes into a Source File by Merging Branched files with their source.
As with Branch, Merge is available from the Tools pull-down, in the PDM Local Vault view.
Selecting Branch from the Tools Pull-down of the Local Vault View
The dialog Box for Merge, is similar to that for Branch but the Branch Name is not specified, as it already exits for the Source files and the Branches.

The Source and Branch file will be checked out for this operation, if they’re not already checked. Only one file can be Merged, at a time.
Like the Branch operation, the Merge operation will appear in the History of the file.

A list of Associated Branches, is available by right clicking on a Branch or the Source file.
Selecting Associated Branches
Selecting a Branch, from the Associated Branches fly-out, will display a report, that lists the Source file and any Branches.

There are options, to open to open the report as a .csv file (in a spreadsheet solution such as Excel), or to save the report as an external file.
Additional notes:
While the Branch operation, can be seen in the History of a file, the file cannot be Rolled Back, to a point before the Branch
While the images in this article, so SOLIDWORKS files, other file types can be Branched.
