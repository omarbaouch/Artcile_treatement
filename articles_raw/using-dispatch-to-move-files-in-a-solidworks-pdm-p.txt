SOLIDWORKS PDM Dispatch Action is a very powerful, but often overlooked tool in
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
, and with PDM 2017, it’s now even more powerful.
In previous releases it was only possible to use the Dispatch action to Copy, Delete, or Rename files in the vault.
In SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2017, the Dispatch action can also be used to
move
files to a different location in the vault. This Move action will maintain the files history within the vault and will update any files referencing that file with the new folder location.
Move/Rename File
Using the SOLIDWORKS PDM Dispatch Action
The Dispatch Action can be triggered manually by a Menu command, during a state transition, during checkout or during add.  The file being Moved/Renamed does not necessarily have to be the file that triggered the Action.  For instance, a dispatch action could be set up to move a PDF export of an approved drawing to an “Archive” folder when the SOLIDWORKS .slddrw file is transitioned to an “Under Change” state.
