By default within a replicated SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional environment, 10 files are replicated per transfer to the target server(s) during scheduled replication.  If you’re experiencing bottlenecks or low bandwidth; it’s a good idea to reduce this number, or, if you have available bandwidth; the number of files can be increased to speed up replication.
This value can be adjusted at any time and is a useful tool for troubleshooting communication problems within a replicated environment.
