<h3>About SOLIDWORKS PDM</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/3d/technology/solidworks-pdm/">SOLIDWORKS PDM</a> is a data management system that allows you to securely store your files on the network but work locally on your computer. All files are securely stored in a vault allowing you to share information only when it’s released, reducing costly errors from using non-approved files. SOLIDWORKS PDM is used to easily manage any file in a multi-user environment while tracking revisions and versions.</p>
<p>Data creation and file management have always gone hand in hand. As a large number of files get created, we rely on a safe and secure place to store them, while also making the data easily accessible to those who need it. PDM Professional makes file organization and storage easy. It’s no wonder DriveWorks and SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional have been the winning combination for design automation and file management for years.</p>
