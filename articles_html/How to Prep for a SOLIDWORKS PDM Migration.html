<p>So, you have decided to migrate your legacy CAD files into <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/3d/technology/solidworks-pdm/">SOLIDWORKS PDM</a> with the help of a 3rd party company or your Value-Added Reseller (VAR). Now what?</p>
<p>How do you prepare for a SOLIDWORKS PDM migration and provide what they need to make the process successful?</p>
<p>Watch the video below as TriMech System Architect – Data Management, Keith Thompson discusses what is important to do in advance when working with a 3rd party helping to migrate your data. Moving CAD files from one storage location to another may seem like a simple task, and it can be if you have a small number of files to move.</p>

<p>In this case, it may be as easy as copy and paste, or Pack and Go in the case of SOLIDWORKS CAD files and may only take a few minutes or a couple of hours to complete. However, <strong>moving thousands of documents can be challenging</strong>. This will take a much longer period, most likely weeks. How will you work with a 3rd party to get this done in a timely manner to <strong>minimize the impact to production and maintain the integrity of your data</strong>?</p>
