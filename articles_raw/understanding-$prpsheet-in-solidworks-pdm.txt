$PRPSheet can be used in an attribute block to map a model property to a custom or configuration specific property of a drawing. This is explained in the Javelin blog article

. This property will then show up under the @ tab of the drawing data card.
Data Card @ tab
The term $PRPSheet, may seem to indicate that a property is being mapped to a drawing’s sheet, but a sheet is not a configuration. Properties can only be mapped as a custom, or configuration specific properties. Since a sheet is not a configuration, properties cannot be mapped to them. You can enter information for each sheet independently in the data card, but this will not be reflected in the drawing sheet itself.
We can show values contained in $PRPSheet in the sheet tabs. This is done by checking ‘
Update in all configurations
‘ in the properties of a field in the data card.
Update all configurations
This will cause all sheet tabs, including the @ tab, to display the same value for that field. In order make make changes for this field, the changes must be made from data card and not the drawing.
