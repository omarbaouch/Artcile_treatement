A back-up can be created using
Collect Support Information
and this method is the easiest, but it may be faster and more convenient to create a back-up directly from SQL Server Management Studio.
From Windows Start, launch Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
Enter all of the required information and press
Connect.
Find vault database to be backed up, under the Databases folder, then right-click on the database and select
Back-up
from Tasks
In the Source section, ensure that the correct database is selected and chose the
Back type.
A full back-up is recommended. Provide a
Name
for the back-up. Optionally a description can be added.  The
Add
and
Remove
buttons can be used to add or remove back-up locations.
Please refer to my blog article

for best practices regarding back-ups.
