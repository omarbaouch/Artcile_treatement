In the dynamic world of design and engineering, staying at the forefront of technological advancements is key to success. With the release of
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2024
, you can look forward to a host of feature enhancements that promise to streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, and elevate overall performance.
In this article, we’ll delve into the specifics of these improvements, focusing on the Assembly Visualization tool, Web2 capabilities, new file type icons, enhanced check-out options, and performance improvements.
Assembly Visualization and SOLIDWORKS PDM Integration:
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2024 introduces seamless integration with the Assembly Visualization tool, allowing users to access PDM variables directly within the tool’s Custom Column dialog box. Now, variables like PDM- or PDM-Date are easily accessible under Properties, enhancing the visualization of data within the Assembly Visualization panel. This facilitates a more intuitive and comprehensive approach to managing assembly data.

The Web2 interface in SOLIDWORKS PDM now empowers users to download specific versions of files and their references. While multiple files cannot be selected for simultaneous download, the Download Version dialog box provides granular control over the version selection and download settings. This enhancement ensures that users can access and work with specific file versions seamlessly, enhancing version control and project management.
File Type Icons for Enhanced Visualization:
File Type Icons for Enhanced Visualization
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2024 introduces new file type icons, providing visual cues for weldment cut list items and files shared using pasted shared overlays. These icons are integrated into various dialog boxes, including File Details, File Operations, and Web2, offering you a quick and visual way to identify file types. However, we should note that cut list item icons are not yet available for SOLIDWORKS BOMs.
Check Out Integration with Change State Command:
PDM 2024 users now have the option to check out a file immediately after completing a change state operation. Customizing the column set of the Do Transition dialog box allows users to include the Check Out system variable. This streamlines your workflow, ensuring that files are checked out seamlessly as their state changes, promoting efficient collaboration and preventing bottlenecks.

Expanded Access to System Variables:
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2024 makes system variables more accessible and available across various interfaces. Several key system variables, such as and, are now available in File List, Quick Search Result, and Search Result column set types. You can also call out the new variable in a default column located in File list. Additionally, the Version tab’s user interface in File Explorer is improved, offering a more comprehensive view of system variables.
Expanded Access to System Variables
Effortless Viewing of License Usage:
PDM users with access to the Admin tool can now view license details without special administrative permissions. The License node in the Administration tool includes sub-nodes for viewing license servers and license usage. This enhancement enables users to manage licenses more effectively, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
