<p>A question I frequently get asked on support is; <em>&#8220;Can I upgrade my SOLIDWORKS version without having to upgrade my SOLIDWORKS PDM client?&#8221;</em></p>

<h3><strong>SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional</strong></h3>
<p><strong>SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional officially supports the same version of SOLIDWORKS and two older versions</strong>.  As an example; SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2016 officially supports SOLIDWORKS 2016, 2015 and 2014.</p>
<h3><strong>SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard</strong></h3>
<p><strong>SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard officially supports same major version of SOLIDWORKS</strong>. As an example; SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard 2016 officially supports SOLIDWORKS 2016.</p>
<blockquote><p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard will not prevent you from using an earlier version of SOLIDWORKS, but it&#8217;s not recommended as certain tools such as Toolbox will not work in the older version.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Service Packs of the same release</h3>
<p><strong>You can use a different service pack of SOLIDWORKS PDM</strong> (e.g. 2016 SP2) <strong>with a different service pack of SOLIDWORKS</strong> (e.g. 2016 SP4)  within the officially supported versions.</p>
<h3>Newer and older [year] version compatibility</h3>
<p><strong>The combination of a newer major version of SOLIDWORKS and an older major version of SOLIDWORKS PDM is NOT supported.</strong></p>
