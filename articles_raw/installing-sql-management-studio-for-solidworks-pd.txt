The backbone of the SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard vault is the database in Microsoft SQL Server Express.The SQL Express server databases can be managed and maintained using the SQL Management Studio.  This program is not installed automatically when installing SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard server components, however it is included with the SOLIDWORKS installation media.  Here are two SQL Management Studio install options:
Option 1:  Automatic SQL Management Studio Install through the SOLIDWORKS Installation Manager
This is definitely the easiest way to install the Management Studio, simply check the option “Install MS SQL Management Tools” under the SQL Server section in the Installation Manager.  This is only possible during the initial installation (or upgrade) of the SOLIDWORKS PDM Server software, so if PDM Standard is already installed, then this won’t be an option.
