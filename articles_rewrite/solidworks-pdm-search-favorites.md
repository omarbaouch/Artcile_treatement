<p>Power users often run the same SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional searchesâ€”checking pending approvals, finding released drawings, or locating data by custom columns. Saving those criteria as a Search Favorite makes them available from the Windows Explorer add-in with only two clicks.</p>

<h2>Create the Favorite</h2>

<p>Build your search using the PDM search card, then open the <strong>Favorites</strong> drop-down and choose <strong>Add to Favorites</strong>.</p>

<h2>Name and Share the Favorite</h2>

<p>Give the favorite a descriptive name and specify which users or groups can see and edit it. Shared favorites keep teams aligned on the same filters and results.</p>
