<p>If you’ve had the honor of being named the local vault administrator then it’s extremely likely that someone has approached you regarding their SOLIDWORKS PDM Permission Assignments:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“I need to be able to </em>&lt;Fill in the blank&gt;<em>, but I can’t.  </em>&lt;Random Name&gt;<em> can, but I’m not allowed.  Why is life so unfair?”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Previously as a vault administrator, it was a constant subject at my desk.  I would often be looking in the vault permissions, checking who had permission to do what and whether I needed to add a group to a folder permission of a new folder.  Within the Administration Tool, there’s a SOLIDWORKS PDM Permission Assignments tool that will allow you to quickly look at a vault folder, and see which groups have permissions assigned to it.</p>
<h3>Permission Assignments</h3>

<ul>
<li>Select the folder you’re interested in;</li>
</ul>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_36289" style="width: 377px"><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Permission-Assignment-Dialog.png"><img alt="Permission Assignments Dialog Box" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36289" height="398" src="/assets/images/Permission-Assignment-Dialog.png" title="" width="367"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-36289"><noscript><img alt="Permission Assignments Dialog Box" height="398" src="/assets/images/Permission-Assignment-Dialog.png" title="" width="367"/></noscript></p></a> Permission Assignments</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Folders</strong> – Lists the folders in the vault</li>
<li><strong>Groups with permissions</strong> – Lists the groups or users that have permissions for the selected folder</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows us to quickly see which groups have permissions assigned to a specific folder, without opening each group properties dialog separately.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Permission Assignments is also available at the User level via the Administration Tool, but as a general rule (outside of the admin user) we recommend only assigning permissions at the group level</p></blockquote>
