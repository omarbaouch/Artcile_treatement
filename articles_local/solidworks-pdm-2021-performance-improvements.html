<p><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/3d/solidworks-pdm-2021/">SOLIDWORKS PDM 2021</a> has improved performance of file-based operations such as Add Files, Check-In, Destroy and other operations related to workflows.</p>
<p>Improved system performance will help you quickly add, check-in, open, and change state of files with large reference structure. The Add Files operation is between 1.5 to 3 times faster in SOLIDWORKS PDM 2021.</p>

<p>The Check-in and change state operations have increased performance by approximately 25%. The Check-in dialog box opens quickly in PDM 2021 with large assemblies or parts with a high number of configurations.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The level of performance improvement can vary depending on the number of files, network bandwidth and CPU cores.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Destroy Files</h2>
<p>In SOLIDWORKS PDM 2021 you can destroy files or folders quicker than before. This operation has significant improvement in performance when destroying a large number of files.</p>
<h3>Other PDM Operations and Workflows</h3>
<p>Performance is significantly improved for the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>For folders containing a very large number of files:
<ul>
<li>Check-in and Check-out of a file</li>
<li>Adding a new file by dragging or by copying and pasting</li>
<li>Creating a new file from a template</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For assemblies with a large number of components at a single level, when working in SOLIDWORKS:
<ul>
<li>Opening files</li>
<li>Saving files</li>
<li>Switching windows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Editing a target file name in the Copy Tree dialog box in a high-latency environment</li>
<li>Using Copy Tree when a user setting is added to clear variable values</li>
</ul>
