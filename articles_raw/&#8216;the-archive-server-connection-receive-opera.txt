One or both of the following error messages can occur when a replicated SOLIDWORKS PDM archive is taken offline and registry keys are not updated correctly:
Archive Server connection Error Message
PDM Error Message
To fix this issue, on the archive server, edit the registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SolidWorks\Applications\PDMWorks Enterprise\ArchiveServer\Vaults\<vaultname>
Then either delete the ‘Replicate’ string, or set the value to zero.
