Following an upgrade of
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
, you may encounter some odd behavior when accessing the vault through Web2.
If you see any of these symptoms, you may have missed one final step in the upgrade process:
Login page hanging indefinitely
Being able to login successfully but not able to navigate between folders
Either hanging indefinitely or being sent back to the Login page when trying to view any details of a file
Or, encountering the error “
Could not open database
“.
These are all symptoms of the same issue, the Web2 application pool using the wrong identity.
This most commonly happens following an upgrade of the software.  That’s because, during the upgrade, the application pool will be reset to the default “
Network Service
” identity and must be modified back to use the Windows Profile that it was using before the upgrade.
In order for Web2 to work properly, the application pool identity must be set to use a Windows Profile that has:
Has
logged into the vault
and
selected a folder in the vault
at least once.
Has been added as a member of the
IIS_IUSRS
group.
Is a member of the local
Administrators
group.
