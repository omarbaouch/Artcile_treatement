<p>Organizations subject to ISO, ITAR, FDA, or similar regulations must prove that design data is secure, traceable, and reviewed by authorized personnel. SOLIDWORKS PDM centralizes document control so that every revision, approval, and access decision can withstand an audit. By configuring audit trails, permissions, and workflows, you can align engineering processes with formal compliance frameworks.</p>

<h2>Create a Reliable Audit Trail</h2>

<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM automatically captures who changed a file, what revision was created, and when the event occurred. Administrators can review this information directly from the file&rsquo;s history tab or aggregate it with SQL reports for certification evidence.</p>

<p>Maintaining this immutable record demonstrates control over design changes and satisfies auditors who require proof of version lineage.</p>

<h2>Enforce Role-Based Permissions</h2>

<p>Granular permissions let you decide who can see, edit, and approve files. Limit manufacturing teams to released PDFs while giving engineering the ability to check out models in designated workflow states. Transition permissions ensure that only qualified approvers can move files into production.</p>

<h2>Automate Electronic Approvals</h2>

<p>Every workflow transition is captured in the database, documenting the approver and time stamp for each state change. Enable electronic signatures to require users to re-enter credentials before releasing a file and create tamper-proof confirmation of digital sign-off.</p>

<h2>Control Sensitive and Obsolete Documents</h2>

<p>Use metadata variables, folder structures, or workflow states to flag controlled documents. Display the control status on data cards, in custom columns, or through PDM Professional categories so teams instantly recognize restricted content.</p>

<p>Build specialized states for obsolete documents that hide or lock files. Transition conditions such as <em>Child Reference State</em> can prevent assemblies or drawings from being released if dependent components are marked obsolete.</p>

<h2>Retain and Locate Every Version</h2>

<p>When users check in files, SOLIDWORKS PDM keeps each version in the archive without requiring manual naming conventions. End users can retrieve historical revisions through file history, while administrators maintain long-term retention policies that meet regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>Powerful search cards and metadata filters locate documents based on part number, project, workflow state, or any other variable. Combining multiple criteria helps auditors quickly confirm that files meet access and approval requirements.</p>

<h2>Invest in Certified Administration</h2>

<p>Compliance programs often require formally trained data management administrators. Enrolling vault managers in SOLIDWORKS PDM Administrator courses ensures the system follows standard operating procedures and aligns with the expectations of regulatory agencies.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Regulated industries depend on traceable, repeatable processes. SOLIDWORKS PDM provides the audit data, workflow control, and secure access needed to document compliance. With disciplined configuration and trained administrators, your data management platform becomes a foundational element of your quality system.</p>
