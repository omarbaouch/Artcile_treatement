<p>The Windows Explorer integration for SOLIDWORKS PDM includes toolbar buttons for check-in, change state, and other vault commands. If you suddenly see only <strong>View File</strong>, your vault view is in Offline Mode.</p>

<h2>Recognize Offline Mode</h2>

<p>Offline Mode hides most commands to prevent accidental edits when the archive server is unreachable. The toolbar displays only the view option as a reminder.</p>

<h2>Return Online</h2>

<p>Choose <strong>Tools &gt; Work Online</strong> from the menu bar. Once the vault reconnects, all configured toolbar buttons return.</p>

<p>Staying aware of the online/offline toggle ensures you always have access to critical SOLIDWORKS PDM data management commands.</p>
