<p>While I was creating a new SOLIDWORKS PDM vault for another article I was writing, I was about to race through the Configure Vault window, like I normally do. When the oft forgotten ‘Use a configuration based on an administrative image export file’ option caught my eye:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_25734" style="width: 553px"><img alt="Creating a new Vault using a SOLIDWORKS PDM Administrative Image" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25734" height="505" src="/assets/images/Configure-Vault.png" title="" width="543"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-25734"><noscript><img alt="Creating a new Vault using a SOLIDWORKS PDM Administrative Image" height="505" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" src="/assets/images/Configure-Vault.png" title="" width="543"/></noscript> Create New Vault</p></div>
<p>I so rarely use this option that I could almost question its worth. Well this option does have some merit and to understand what it does, we need to look at PDM Administration.</p>
<p>Any node of the Vault settings or all of the Vault settings can be exported from the right-mouse shortcut menu and then imported into another vault.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_25735" style="width: 401px"><img alt="Export Vault" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25735" height="194" src="/assets/images/export-vault.png" title="" width="391"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-25735"><noscript><img alt="Export Vault" height="194" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" src="/assets/images/export-vault.png" title="" width="391"/></noscript> Export Vault</p></div>
<p>Let’s say we want to create a Sandbox (test) Vault, which is always a good idea. Now when you create a new vault, it can be based on the exported SOLIDWORKS PDM Administrative Image Vault settings mentioned earlier.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_25737" style="width: 554px"><img alt="Use a configuration based admin export file" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25737" height="241" src="/assets/images/Using-cex.png" title="" width="544"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-25737"><noscript><img alt="Use a configuration based admin export file" height="241" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" src="/assets/images/Using-cex.png" title="" width="544"/></noscript> Use a configuration based admin export file</p></div>
<p>You may be saying to yourself, “so what, I can drag and drop nodes between vaults”. While that is true, and drag and drop may be faster, exporting a vault’s settings allows you to save snapshots of your vault, that can then be tested under various conditions. At any time, you can reload these snapshots/vault setting exports, to perform additional tests. You can even export individual nodes and test different combinations of those nodes.</p>
