<p>Included with the enhancements to the SOLIDWORKS PDM File Version Upgrade Tool in <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/tag/solidworks-pdm-2018/">SOLIDWORKS PDM 2018</a>, is a more detailed summary of the files ready to upgrade:</p>

<p>The new summary lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of SOLIDWORKS versions to update.</li>
<li>Number of SOLIDWORKS part file versions.</li>
<li>Number of SOLIDWORKS drawing file versions.</li>
<li>Number of SOLIDWORKS assemblies file versions.</li>
<li>Work instruction file names with the number of files in each work file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which gives us a little more information before we hit that &#8216;Go&#8217; button and let the tool do it&#8217;s magic.</p>
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>To upgrade a file version; each file needs to be Checked Out &gt; Opened in SOLIDWORKS &gt; Saved &gt; Checked back in.  This can be time-consuming when dealing with a large number of files.  If you&#8217;re setting the tool to run overnight, you&#8217;ll need to make sure there&#8217;s enough time to complete the upgrade before users need to access them again.  This summary gives us a better idea of how many files are currently selected for upgrade.</p>
<p>In some scenarios, it&#8217;s better to break this up into several projects or add multiple clients to complete the upgrade to ensure there&#8217;s enough time to complete the upgrade before users return to the vault.</p>
