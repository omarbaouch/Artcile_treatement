SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2021
introduces the possibility to show a Treehouse view from any file’s Where Used tab.
With the Treehouse view, you can visually navigate through all assemblies and drawings that use a file. This can save you the time you would take to browse to different parent components from the List view, and many times having to browse back to the original file. You can also select one or multiple files and use the context menu (right-click) to check-out, check-in, browse to files, and start many other actions.
To enable this functionality, simply navigate to the Where Used tab, press the button on the top right corner of the tab, and select
Treehouse view
.

NOTE
: This functionality was already present in the Contains tab since version 2020
SP2
, thus some people may have missed this because it was not part of a major release. It is always a good idea to check out what’s new in every Service Pack. You may find a hidden gem.
