<p>When creating a  BOM, it is obvious that permissions need to be assigned in the  Bill of Material – BOM dialogue box.</p>
<p><img alt="Set permissions in BOM dialogue box" height="220" src="/assets/images/Set-permissions-in-BOM-dialogue-box.png" title="" width="235"/><noscript><img alt="Set permissions in BOM dialogue box" height="220" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" src="/assets/images/Set-permissions-in-BOM-dialogue-box.png" title="" width="235"/></noscript></p>
<p> </p>
<p>What is often forgotten is to give the User/Group permissions to a BOM.</p>
<p><img alt="Folder permissions" height="478" src="/assets/images/Folder-permissions.png" title="" width="593"/><noscript><img alt="Folder permissions" height="478" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" src="/assets/images/Folder-permissions.png" title="" width="593"/></noscript></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Permissions should be set at the vault root folder. Both <strong>Activate computed BOM</strong> and <strong>See computed BOM</strong> permissions can be set.</p>
<p>If permissions are not set for either of the two, above locations, the user will receive a message “Please create at least one bill of materials type column set before using this function. Column sets can be set up in the Administration Tool”, when accessing a file in the vault.</p>
