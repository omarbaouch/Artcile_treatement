, by default the Windows Search Service supports indexing the following files types;

How to include PDF files in the PDM Content Search
We can include other file types by installing its corresponding third-party iFilter.  After a new iFilter is installed the archive must be reindexed to include the new file type in the content search.
Step 1 – Add the PDF iFilter to the server running Windows Search
We can download and install the standalone PDF iFilter from Adobe
here
, but current versions of Adobe Acrobat® and Adobe Reader® include the iFilter when installed, so in most instances; it’s easier to install the full program so we can view PDFs on the server as well as index them.
Step 2 – Add and check in some files for testing

As the iFilter was added after the content search was set up, we’ll need to rebuild the indexes to include the pdf files;
Indexing Options
Advanced > Index Settings Tab

Rebuild the indexes to include the PDF files
Note
: Before testing, we need to wait for the rebuild to complete, in larger vaults this may take some time
