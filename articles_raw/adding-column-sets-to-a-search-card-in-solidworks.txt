Understanding and Utilizing Column Sets in SOLIDWORKS PDM
Column Sets are an incredibly useful feature in SOLIDWORKS PDM, offering a level of personal customization that can significantly enhance your PDM experience. This article will guide you through the process of setting up column sets specifically for Search Cards, a feature not covered in our previous article on
Customizing Column Sets
for regular Local Vault View navigation.
Before being able to add the Search Result Column to the Data Card, you will need to have a column set created for it. If none exist, then use the “Customizing Column Sets” guide above on how to create one.
How to add Column Sets to Search Card
Once you have a column set ready, you can add it to your search card.
Start by going to the Cards node in the PDM Administration tool and expanding “Search Cards”. This will display all the available search cards.

From here you can select the desired search card by double clicking on it.
Then select the checkbox in the “View” column and you can even make it a preferred column set if you’d like.
