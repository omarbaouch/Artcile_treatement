SOLIDWORKS PDM ships with Predefined Vault Configurations, which can be useful in the understanding of PDM components, such Data Cards and Workflows. These components can also be built on, to create your own components. When Configuring the Vault, three Predefined Configurations are available. The Default contains Data Cards for many common file types, the SOLIDWORKS Quick Start contains Data Cards associated with SOLIDWORKS file types and Empty can be used to create each component from the beginning.

If Default or SOLIDWORKS Quick Start Configuration are chosen, details of each component be selected and in the case of the Default, The Dispatch Add-in and Tasks can added, as well.
