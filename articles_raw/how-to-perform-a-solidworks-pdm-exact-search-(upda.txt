When completing a search in SOLIDWORKS PDM using the name field; when two or more words separated by a space the search will use an OR operation.   Or, if you’re searching one word, what happens is a LIKE operation.  In large vaults, these searches will return a lot of mostly unwanted results.  In this article, we’ll look at how to perform a SOLIDWORKS PDM
exact
search.
Example 1
In this example; I’m searching for the part named
Example 1 A
Search: Example 1 A
The search that’s actually happening is:
Example
OR
1
OR
A
.
It’s returning anything matching Example, 1 or A which in large vaults will return a lot of results.
Example 2
If I’m searching
ABC
Search: ABC
The search that’s actually happening is;
LIKE
‘%
ABC
%.
It’s returning anything matching ABC which again in large vaults will return a lot of results.
How to Perform an Exact Search
To
search for an exact string, we can use double-quotes
.
Searching “Example 1 A” will only return that filename;
Search: “Example 1 A”
Searching “ABC” won’t help, as it will return all the options that contain ABC, but have any string of characters before or after ABC….we have a couple of options here, we could include the extension “ABC.txt”;
This narrows it down, but it includes results with characters ahead of “ABC”.  To narrow it down to only ABC.txt, we can add an operator for exact entry =ABC.txt;
Let’s look at another scenario here…we know the filename contains
ABC
, but we need to only return the option ending with
F
, we could use a
wildcard
“ABC*F.*”;
