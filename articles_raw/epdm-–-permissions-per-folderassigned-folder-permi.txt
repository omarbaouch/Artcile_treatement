I have found that there is some confusion about what the differences between
Permissions per Folder
and
Assigned Folder Permissions
.
In
Permissions per Folder
, we see all the folders in the vault. Here we can assign permissions to folders, that users/groups currently have no permissions to.
In
Assigned Folder Permissions
, only the folders that a user/group has been assigned permissions, will be shown. Here we can modify existing folder permissions.
