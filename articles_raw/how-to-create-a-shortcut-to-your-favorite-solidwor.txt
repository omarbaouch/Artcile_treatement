Did you know that you can create a
SOLIDWORKS PDM
Search shortcut directly on your desktop?
Being the responsible PDM user that you are, it’s safe to assume that you’re checking in your documents at least once a day?  A search shortcut can be a speedy way to round up all the files you currently have checked out minutes before the end of your day and check them in.
You can create a shortcut to any search, but for this example I’m going to show you how to create a shortcut to one of my search favorites –
checked out files.
Via Windows Explorer navigate to the SOLIDWORKS PDM installation folder.
Default location – C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Enterprise PDM
SOLIDWORKS PDM installation folder
Find the file
Search.exe
then right-click and select
Copy
Copy Search.exe
Navigate to where you’d like to create the shortcut f
or this example I’ll use my desktop
then right-click and select
Paste Shortcut
Paste Shortcut
Right-click on the new shortcut and select
Properties
Properties of the shortcut
Add the following information to the
Target
field:
“C:\Program Files\SolidWorks Enterprise PDM\Search.exe” “/V:[Vault Name]” “/F:[Search Favorite Name]”
My Vault Name is
JavVault
, and my favorite search I’d like to point to is called
Checked Out Files – Justin W
.  My target section will look like this:
“C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Enterprise PDM\Search.exe” “/V:
JavVault
” “/F:
Checked Out Files – Justin.W
“
Shortcut Properties
Now every time I double click this shortcut I have a list of all the files I currently have checked out, which I can easily check-in before the end of my work day.
