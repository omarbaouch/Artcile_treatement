If you want to rename SOLIDWORKS PDM Archive Server, follow these steps to ensure proper functioning of SOLIDWORKS PDM after renaming the server machine.
Step 1: Backup and lock access
The first step is to ensure you have a recent backup of the archive and the SQL database. Once the backups are complete, you need to ensure  that during the rename operation no one can access the PDM vault; refer to my recent article on
how to block PDM login
.
Step 2: Rename the Server
The next step is rename the server. There are a number of ways of doing this. In the below image I illustrate how this is done through Windows System Settings.

Step 3: Edit SQL Tables
Now that the server is renamed, we need to make make changes through SQL Server Management Studio. Expand the Tables folder, for your vault and edit the tables
ArchiveServers
and
SystemInfo
.
Edit Table
Update the
ArchiveServerName
ONLY
, for each of these tables. If this a replicated environment, ONLY update the server that was renamed.
Updated name
Once the Tables have been updated,
restart the Archive Server service
.
Step 4: Edit Client Registry
Each client must now be updated to reflect the new Archive Server name.  Edit the registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SolidWorks\Application\PDMWorks Enterprise\Databases\VAULTNAME
And update ServerLoc with the new server name.
Registry Editor
If the above key is empty, the file vault view is most likely “private”, in this case, edit the key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SolidWorks\Applications\PDMWorks Enterprise\Vaults\VAULTNAME
Next delete the registry:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SolidWorks\Application\PDMWorks Enterprise\ConisioAdmin
Deleting this key is only required  if the vault view is “private”. Once the changes have been made, on the client, reboot the system and log into the vault.
If the server is part of a replicated environment, ensure that server name is correct in your replication settings.
