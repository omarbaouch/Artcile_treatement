The
Rollback feature
in
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2017
has been enhanced to allow
a
parent file to be rolled back
with
its child references
and files indicated as sub-parents (such as drawing files) to a previous version, state and revision.  Previously this command could only be performed on individual files and didn’t include referenced files.
NOTE
: This function should be used with caution as it permanently deletes file versions.  Permission should be limited to the appropriate personnel only.
Navigate to the selected file and
Right-click > History;
Right-click > History

Select previous version > Rollback
Warning! This action will PERMANENTLY DELETE ALL VERSIONS that were created after the selected point and cannot be reversed
