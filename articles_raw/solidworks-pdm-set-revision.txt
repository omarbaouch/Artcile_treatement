Do you have a special workflow for migrated data? Does it look something like this:
Migration Workflow
Or this:
Alternative Migration Workflow
New
Set Revision
function
These workflows aren’t necessary anymore with the new
Set Revision
function in
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2016
.
Let’s take a look…
In this example, all the data cards have the appropriate revisions and need to be synced with the systems revisions, so they increment appropriately when transitioned through the production workflow.
Select all the files you would like to sync, then via explorer go to
Modify
>
Set Revision
:
Set Revision
Right-click >
Select All
Select All
Right click within the grid and select
Set All New Revision Values To Card Variable Value
Update all revision values
Note: you can also add a comment to this process.
Add Comments
Click OK then: review the data
Revision history event recorded
Now the data card revisions will match the system revisions and increment appropriately as per your production workflow without the need of a special workflow.
