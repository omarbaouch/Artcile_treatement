In
SOLIDWORKS PDM
we can map SOLIDWORKS Drawing Sheet details directly to a Data Card, making the information easily accessible to users.  In this article we’re going to look at how to create that relationship within the vault.
How to map the SOLIDWORKS Drawing Sheet to a Data Card
In this example, we’re going to map the
current sheet
and the
total number of sheets
values…
The first step is we’ll need to create the variables to store this information, then create the attribute mappings accordingly;
Administration Tool > Variables > New Variable…
Name;
Current Sheet
Type;
Text
New attribute;
Block Name:
$PRP
Attribute Name:
SW-Current Sheet
Extension:
slddrw
Edit Variable
Name;
Current Sheet
Type;
Text
New attribute;
Block Name:
$PRP
Attribute Name:
SW-Total Sheets
Extension:
slddrw
Sheet Total Variable
Next, we’ll need to link these variables to a data card;
Administration Tool > Cards > File Cards > SOLIDWORKS Drawing Card;
Link up edit boxes to the new variables;
Link to data card
Then the Drawing Sheet value should populate directly to the SOLIDWORKS PDM Data Card;
