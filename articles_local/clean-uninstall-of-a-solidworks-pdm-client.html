<p>Sometimes you may need to <strong>completely uninstall SOLIDWORKS PDM Client, including all Program Files and Registry Keys</strong>. This process is helpful when troubleshooting a problematic SOLIDWORKS PDM Client machine.</p>
<p>These steps will allow you to perform a clean SOLIDWORKS PDM Client uninstall and remove any installation files left behind and also remove registry entries.</p>
<p>Perform these steps only on the client machine where no server components are installed. If these steps are used on the machine where server components are installed, the PDM vault may stop functioning.</p>
<p>Before performing these steps, make sure all files are checked in to the PDM vault on the workstation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check in</strong> all files, if unable able to login to the SOLIDWORKS PDM vault view, go to step 4.</li>
<li><strong>Right click</strong> on the local vault view, select <strong>Delete File Vault View</strong>

<li>If unable to login and check in all files during the <strong>step 3</strong>, select “<strong>Leave the local contents of the file vault view as normal files and folders</strong>“. This will leave the files in the local folder, all the changes made after the files were checked out are not lost.
