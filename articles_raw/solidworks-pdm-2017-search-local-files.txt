A great new feature in
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2017
Standard and Professional, is the ‘SOLIDWORKS PDM Search Local Files’ command.  This new command can be accessed through the right-click shortcut menu in the Vault View. This command can be used to
search for any files that exist in the local vault view that have NOT yet been added to the vault
(so they are not yet in Private State).
Search Local Files command
PDM files are found in the local vault view if:
The file was created or copied into the vault view folder while the user was working offline,
Or if there was a temporary interruption in the connection to the Database server, preventing a new file from automatically being added to the vault.
Now through a single command any local files, located in any sub folders in the vault view can be quickly found, and then added to the vault.
