SOLIDWORKS 2016 PDM Standard
Now that
SOLIDWORKS 2016 SP0 is available
, a NEW PDM tool is also available to eligible customers,
SOLIDWORKS 2016 PDM Standard
. We’ve been receiving calls from customers wondering why they cannot yet install and begin using PDM Standard.
SOLIDWORKS has yet to “enable” PDM Standard on customers’ licenses. The “enabling”, or “turning on” if you will, is scheduled to happen sometime
mid-November, 2015
.
Eligible customers will be notified when their PDM Standard license is available. Until then, don’t let the anticipation get to you too badly! 🙂
