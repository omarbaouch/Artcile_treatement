<p>Losing hours of schematic work because of file management mistakes is painful. SOLIDWORKS PDM reduces that risk by controlling versions, protecting archives, and automating backups for SOLIDWORKS Electrical projects. The Link to PDM configuration manager lets administrators decide how deeply the two systems integrate.</p>

<h2>Centralize Export Rules</h2>

<p>Define which deliverables—project archives, drawings, or PDF packages—are produced every time data is pushed to PDM. Standardizing exports keeps your vault consistent.</p>

<h2>Integration Paths for Every Team</h2>

<h3>1. Manual Folder Exports</h3>

<p>Save project packages to any folder, including locations outside the vault. Users manage check-in, comments, and revisions through Windows Explorer—ideal for teams that want flexibility similar to mechanical workflows.</p>

<h3>2. Vault-Based Folder Exports</h3>

<p>Point exports to a folder inside the vault so every push automatically creates a new version. By including reports and drawings, stakeholders across SOLIDWORKS PDM see the latest electrical outputs with a single click.</p>

<h3>3. Advanced Check-In/Check-Out</h3>

<p>When engineers maintain their own SOLIDWORKS Electrical databases, activate the integrated check-in/out workflow. Projects are retrieved from PDM directly within SOLIDWORKS Electrical and locked for other users until checked in.</p>

<h3>4. SOLIDWORKS PDM Electrical Connector</h3>

<p>For SOLIDWORKS Electrical Schematic 2018 and newer, the Electrical Connector delivers full parity with mechanical PDM workflows. Designers check out projects, update data, and collaborate through the same interface as their mechanical counterparts.</p>

<p>See the connector in action in the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWIYzgkgwNo">SOLIDWORKS 2018 – PDM Electrical Connector</a>.</p>
