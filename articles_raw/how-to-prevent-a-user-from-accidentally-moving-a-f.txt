Is there a setting in SOLIDWORKS PDM to prevent a user from accidentally moving a folder in a vault?
The following steps can be used to prevent a user from accidentally moving a folder in the vault because of a ‘lack of permission’ by disabling the ‘Move folder’ privilege.
In the Administration tool > Users or Groups properties > Select Folder Permissions > Permissions per Folder uncheck ‘Move folder’ on the folder in question.
