<p>Javelin is hosting SOLIDWORKS Simulation and SOLIDWORKS PDM Events in September.</p>
<p>Attend a complimentary SOLIDWORKS seminar in September to discover how you can use <a href="http://www.javelin-tech.com/main/products/analysis.htm">SOLIDWORKS Simulation</a> to <strong>reduce costs and speed time to market</strong> by reducing the number of physical prototypes before going into production, and learn how <a href="http://www.javelin-tech.com/main/products/pdm.htm">SOLIDWORKS PDM</a> will help you get your design data under control, <strong>securely store and index your data, apply version control, and share and collaborate on designs online</strong> with people outside your organization.</p>
<p>Javelin is hosting four events in <strong>Edmonton, Alberta</strong> and <strong>Winnipeg, Manitoba</strong> starting on September 12th. Register today to secure your seat!</p>
