<p>When working across multiple projects and teams, keeping up with the latest file version or revision can be a hassle.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/3d/technology/solidworks-pdm-standard/">SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard</a> and <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/3d/technology/solidworks-pdm-professional/">SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional</a>, you can maintain versions and revisions through your PDM vault and track the updates made to your projects.</p>
<p>Watch the on-demand webinar below to learn the difference between versions and revisions. We will go through how they are created, how to tell the differences between the two, as well as how/if they can be configured. We will take a look at the history of the file to see some differences, as well as discuss forcing comments for the two different types. Lastly, we discuss how you can use cold storage with regards to revisions and versions.</p>
