Changing the computer that is used as the SOLIDWORKS PDM License Server is actually very easy and can be accomplished quickly in a single step, even if there are many users or multiple vaults involved.
On
any
client computer, open the
PDM Administration
console and log into
any
vault as the
Admin
user.
Double click on the “
Licensing
” node to open the “
Set License
” dialogue.
Add Server
On the
Server List
tab, click “
Add…
” then enter the port number (the default licensing port is 25734) and name of the new license server using the format
25734@servername.
Once you have added the new SOLIDWORKS PDM License Server, you can remove the existing server by selecting it in the list and clicking “
Remove
“.
The
License
node information is shared among all vaults whose databases reside on the same instance of Microsoft SQL Server, so if you have multiple vaults, you should only have to edit the
License
node once.
Once this change is made, all users should Exit out of SOLIDWORKS PDM and log back in so they can begin using the new SOLIDWORKS PDM License Server.
License Server has been changed
NOTE: If users do not log out, after about a 1 hour grace period, they will no longer be able to access the vault until they right-click on the PDM “blueberry” and Exit the software.
