<p>New in <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/3d/technology/solidworks-pdm/">SOLIDWORKS PDM 2020</a>, for transitions that include dynamic notifications, you receive a warning if you have not selected a user or group to receive a notification.</p>
<p>Previously in SOLIDWORKS PDM, if you submit a file through a transition with dynamic notification and if a user/group was not selected to receive the notification, there was no warning that notification will not be sent out. In SOLIDWORKS PDM 2020 a warning is displayed if you move a file from one state to another using transition with dynamic notifications.</p>
