<p>In <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/3d/technology/solidworks-pdm/">SOLIDWORKS PDM 2020</a> the performance of the SOLIDWORKS PDM Add-in has improved significantly. Enhancements include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>SOLIDWORKS PDM task pane tree refreshes faster</strong> and the commands in the SOLIDWORKS PDM toolbar are correctly enabled in the task pane instantaneously when you select a file.</li>
<li>The <strong>data in the task pane tree loads in the background</strong> when you select a file in the task pane tree. The calls to the database are eliminated.</li>
<li>In the Feature Manager design tree or in the graphics area, when you right-click a file and select SOLIDWORKS PDM, the menus are correctly enabled.</li>
<li>When you select a file in the graphics area or in the Feature Manager design tree, the file listed in the task pane tree is selected and all the available commands are enabled.</li>
<li>The <strong>improved communication between client and the PDM Server</strong> delivers a faster experience over all in the CAD add-in similar to the File Explorer.</li>
