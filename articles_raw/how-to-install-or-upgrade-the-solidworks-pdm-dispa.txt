When upgrading the SOLIDWORKS PDM file vault to a new version, the add-ins in the vault will not automatically update.  You can
view a step by step guide to upgrading the Task Add-in
.  In this article, we are going to look at upgrading the Dispatch Add-in.
It is recommended to run the same major and service pack version of the Dispatch add-in as the current major and service pack version of SOLIDWORKS PDM.
First, we need to remove the existing SOLIDWORKS PDM Dispatch Add-in (don’t worry you won’t lose any existing scripts):
Step 1: Administration Tool > Add-ins > Dispatch >
Right-Click
> Remove
Note if installing for the first time, skip to step 2
Remove the SOLIDWORKS PDM Dispatch Add-in
Step 2: Administration Tool
>
File
>
Open
Change the filter to show “.caf” files
Browse to the installation location for PDM and the “Default Data” folder (by default the path is “C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS PDM\Default Data”)
Click to Open
Dispatch.caf
Open Dispatch File
Step 3: Drag-and-drop the Dispatch add-in into the Administration Tool Add-ins
Drag-and-drop the Dispatch add-in into the Administration Tool Add-ins
Step 4: Close the Admin Tool and Reboot the client workstation
