<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Conditions are powerful tools for controlling document flow, through a Workflow Transition. In a previous article titled, <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2015/05/epdm-transition-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOLIDWORKS PDM Transition Conditions</a>, I looked at the general use of Conditions. Most of the available Conditions, such as Category, File Path, Revision and Variables are self explanatory, but a SOLIDWORKS PDM Object Type condition can be a little confusing.</p>

<p>With Object Type, PDM is filtering data passing through a Transition, by type of Object it is. The Object can be one of three entities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File:</strong> With this filter, only physical files are allowed to pass through a transition. The File Object Type should not be confused with Filepath. Filepath filters by file name, extension, or path.</li>
<li><strong>BOM:</strong> Named BOM&#8217;s are saved from a Computed BOM&#8217;s. These BOM&#8217;s can be checked in and out, as well as being &#8220;revisioned&#8221;. This Filter will only allow named BOM&#8217;s to pass through a Transition.</li>
<li><strong>Item:</strong> An Item consists entirely of metadata, that can be used to collect the entire &#8220;product definition&#8221; of a project. This can include CAD data, documentation and other supporting documents. Items don&#8217;t themselves contain files, but they can be linked to files. With this filter, only items pass through a Transition.</li>
</ul>
