SOLIDWORKS PDM
Graphically view the workflow state, as well as other PDM data, of SOLIDWORKS assemblies using assembly visualization in SOLIDWORKS PDM.
Improve data protection and tracking by ensuring that reference information is hidden for users who don’t have access to the referenced file, and by enabling users to check out and undo checkout in the file history. Experience shorter response times when performing common operations such as adding files, checking in, changing state, and using Copy Tree.
