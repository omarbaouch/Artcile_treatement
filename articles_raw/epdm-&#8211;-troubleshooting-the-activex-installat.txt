The information

If the security settings are set too high in Internet Explorer, the installation may not start. A warning message that the Web client cannot be initialized will be displayed.
Check security settings by Accessing the Windows Control Panel and selecting Internet Options.
Select the Security tab and lower the default Level.
Add the Web Share to trusted sites.
Customize the security level to allow ActiveX components to be installed.
If the system has a content blocker, such as a virus scanning utility or pop-up blocker, the Active X control might be prevented from installing.
Allow pop-ups for URLs
Disable the content blocker.
The user lacks sufficient permissions to perform the initial ActiveX Web client installation.
Increase the users’ computer account permissions to allow them to install Web client components.
Have an administrator log in and install the Web client components.
