The benefits of
copy tree
and
how to use it
have been well documented.  Similar to Copy Tree, SOLIDWORKS 2015 and 2016 include the
Move Tree
feature, which instead of copying; will
move
partial or entire file and folder structures, including related drawings, to another folder or folders maintaining all references.
In this example, I’m going to move an assembly from a folder and separate the drawing files from the models.
The Move Tree feature can be accessed via Windows Explorer;
Select the assembly:
Tools
>
Move Tree
I need all drawings to be moved also, so I’ll check the box within
Settings
to
Include Drawings
;
The majority of the files are going to go to the new folder
\JavVault\Projects\New Flashlight Models
, so I’ll update default destination to there:
I need the drawings to be saved in
\JavVault\Projects\New Flashlight Drawings
so I’ll sort the files by type and select the two drawing files and edit their
Destination Folder Path
,
Then complete the process by selecting
Move Tree
;
Now the files are moved with drawings and models separated, references updated and the file history is maintained;
