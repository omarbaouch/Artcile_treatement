<p>Last year when SolidWorks announced it&#8217;s Electrical Package, it had every one intrigued with the hope &amp; possibility of unifying the overall design process. After crossing into uncharted territory, it merged the Electrical Schematic world with the Mechanical 3D world and created a robust product. The product seamlessly works with it&#8217;s SQL Database for fast real time data management.</p>
