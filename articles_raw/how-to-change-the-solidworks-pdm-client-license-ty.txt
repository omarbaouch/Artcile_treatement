PDM Client License Types
When installing the SOLIDWORKS PDM Client you can select from 3 different license types:  Editor, Contributor, or Viewer.  It is very important to make sure that you select the correct license type for the PDM licenses that you own, otherwise, you will receive an error when trying to log into the vault.
The capabilities of these license types will depend on whether they are being used in a Professional or Standard environment.

Modifying your Solidworks Install
This method uses the Solidworks installation manager, the same tool used when first installing Solidworks and PDM.
Navigate to your installed apps and choose to modify your Solidworks install (or the PDM client). If the modify button is not selectable, Solidworks was installed by an admin image, and you will have to use one of the other options to change your client type.
Modifying the Solidworks Install

PDM Client Options
Registry Edit
The PDM client type is stored in the Windows Registry, each of the above steps are just fancy ways of editing that registry. This option is the fastest method but
i
f you are not familiar with working within the Registry, you should not attempt this process. Irreparable damage to the operating system or installed software can occur, if some areas are edited or deleted.
The client type is stored in the PTID registry value under:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SolidWorks\Applications\PDMWorks Enterprise\
CAD Editor > {05AD35C4-8A9A-4114-B51F-32186222ABA1}
Contributor > {E2BE88CF-6E17-43e2-A837-C1051F3E4EDB}
Viewer > {CC72DD26-1A34-4209-B50B-21C7DD5E29F6}
In the example below the client is set to pull a CAD Editor license. Double click on PTID and change the value data to the desired client type, restart Windows Explorer and you are done.
