SOLIDWORKS PDM Revision control has always been the most important reason why customers are adopting the PDM system.  The term “revision control” however can mean different things to different people.  Fundamentally, it is important to
keep an ongoing history of a part or product design
but when it comes down to implementing a PDM system, it is important to make a plan and ensure you not only have a way to track the changes but also
standardize and automate as much of the process as possible
.  The end result is not only a reduction in errors related to using the wrong revisions but there is a potential for a tremendous amount of time savings.
