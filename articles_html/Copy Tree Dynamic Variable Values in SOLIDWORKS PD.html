<p>One of my favorite enhancements in <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/3d/technology/solidworks-pdm/">SOLIDWORKS PDM 2018</a> is a new option to use dynamic values when updating Variables while performing a <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2014/07/solidworks-pdm-copy-tree/">Copy Tree</a>.  In the past, this functionality only allowed Administrators to either <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2016/05/automatically-clearing-copy-tree-data-variables/">clear values</a> or set <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2011/10/resetting-revsion/">static values</a> for Variables in files that are created by a Copy Tree command.</p>
<p>Now a new &#8220;Value&#8221; dialog box, shown below, will display when you click in the box beside the Variable name.  The &gt; button will present a drop list of dynamic values that can be selected from.</p>

<h3>Copy Tree Dynamic Variable Values</h3>
<p>Here is what these selection will produce:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current time</strong>:  This will be the time when the Copy Tree command is performed.</li>
<li><strong>File Name</strong>:  This is the name of the SOURCE file that is being copied by the Copy Tree command including the file extension.</li>
<li><strong>File name without extension</strong>:  The file name of the SOURCE file, but with the extension removed.</li>
<li><strong>File Path</strong>:  The folder path for the SOURCE file that is being copied as displayed in the &#8220;Found In&#8221; column of the Copy Tree command dialogue box.  (If the source file set contains references in multiple folders, the &#8220;File Path&#8221; value written to each file created by the Copy Tree will match the &#8220;Found In&#8221; value for that file)</li>
<li><strong>Logged in user</strong>:  This is the value in the &#8220;Login name&#8221; field in the User Properties for the user who launches the Copy Tree command.</li>
<li><strong>Target File Name</strong>:  This is the &#8220;Target File Name&#8221; that the User specifies in the Copy Tree command dialogue for the file being created.</li>
<li><strong>Target File name without extension</strong>:  This is the &#8220;Target File Name&#8221; only, with the extension information removed.</li>
<li><strong>Target File Path</strong>:  This is the &#8220;Destination Folder Path&#8221; that the user sets for the file when performing the Copy Tree.</li>
<li><strong>Today&#8217;s date</strong>:  This will be the date that the Copy Tree command is performed.</li>
<li><strong>User &#8211; Full name</strong>:  This is the value in the &#8220;Full name&#8221; field in the User Properties for the user who launches the Copy Tree command.</li>
<li><strong>User &#8211; initials</strong>:  This is the value in the &#8220;Initials&#8221; field in the User Properties for the user who launches the Copy Tree command.</li>
<li><strong>User &#8211; User data</strong>:  This is the value in the &#8220;User data&#8221; field in the User Properties for the user who launches the Copy Tree command.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any combination of these dynamic values can be used as well.</p>
