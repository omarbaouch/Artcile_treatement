<p>A clean installation of SolidWorks consists of uninstalling SolidWorks and deleting certain keys in the Windows registry.</p>
<p>These keys reside in:<br/>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\…<br/>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\…</p>
<p>Care must be taken when deleting these keys in order to prevent breaking the link between the vault and your local vault view.</p>
<p>Breaking this link very rarely results in data loss on the local client if have a good understanding of how the vault works, but the potential does exist.<br/>
If you have this happen, it is best to contact your SolidWorks resellers’ support help desk to obtain assistance.</p>
