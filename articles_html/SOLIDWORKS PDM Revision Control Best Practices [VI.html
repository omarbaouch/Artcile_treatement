<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Revision control has always been the most important reason why customers are adopting the PDM system.  The term &#8220;revision control&#8221; however can mean different things to different people.  Fundamentally, it is important to <strong>keep an ongoing history of a part or product design</strong> but when it comes down to implementing a PDM system, it is important to make a plan and ensure you not only have a way to track the changes but also <strong>standardize and automate as much of the process as possible</strong>.  The end result is not only a reduction in errors related to using the wrong revisions but there is a potential for a tremendous amount of time savings.</p>
