In the world of SOLIDWORKS PDM, nothing is truly gone until it’s
DESTROYED
.  If you mistakenly delete a file (we all make mistakes…right?), don’t worry because SOLIDWORKS PDM has your back and using the recycle bin we can recover a deleted file.
Required permissions
To restore a deleted file, requires the folder permission:

How To Recover a Deleted File
The SOLIDWORKS PDM recycle bin can be accessed via the folder properties;
Accessing the SOLIDWORKS PDM recycle bin
NOTE
: In this example, I’m looking at the root level of the vault, therefore it will show ALL deleted files, to help narrow down the list of files you can use the parent folder where the file was deleted.
Select the
Deleted Items
tab and enable the
Include items in sub-folders
checkbox.
Include items in sub-folders
From here, we can scroll to the required file, then;
Right-Click
>
Recover.
Recover Deleted Files
The file will be then restored to the original location it was deleted from;
Recovered Deleted File
And the file history will be updated to reflect the recovery:
