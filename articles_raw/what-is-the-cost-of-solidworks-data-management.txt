How much is a lack of Data Management costing your business?
A lack of data management can be very costly for your time and business especially with the way most of us work today. How many of these situations do you experience in your business on a daily basis…
File open and save times are very slow!
With many of us working from remote home offices, these performance issues have increased, and data has become even more disconnected with workarounds.
I can’t find my files
: Scouring hard drives folders with Windows File Explorer search can help but is very slow and limited. So much time and productivity are lost trying to track down data, which inevitably ends in unnecessary recreation of parts!
Am I using the latest version?
So now I finally found a file and sent it to the shop floor. The part gets machined… but when assembled, it doesn’t fit… was it the latest revision? How much cost is incurred from scrap and penalties from product delivery delays?
I spend too much time on administrative tasks!
Different people need different forms of consumable data. Such as PDF files of drawings, DXF files of sheet metal flat pattern, or Excel-based BOM.  How about entering the same data over and over again; we enter the same part numbers, descriptions, materials, finishes, customer data into part files, drawing title blocks, bill of materials, then again in other business systems like an ERP. How much wasted time, and worse, how many errors are not detected?
I need past revisions of parts!
Your customer just contacted you looking for a replacement part from a product they purchased five years ago. How quickly can you zero in on all the parts and the revision level they were at back then. Back to the situation of not being able to find the file and having to reverse engineer the part. Costly for you and the client.
It’s hard to share files with other users and offices!
Your satellite office needs a file. You suffer from lost productivity finding the file, creating the email and another copy of the file, then lose track of who has the latest version after sending it.
What does a Data Management system do?
The main reason for using a data management system is to centralize and secure your data. The system will maintain a history and audit trail, automate the creation of consumable files and can make data more self-serving. For example, Bill of Materials (BOM) and consumables can be requested and accessed at the appropriate time. The performance boost from working from a local cache is especially beneficial for CAD designers. You can push and pull data between different business systems to eliminate duplicate data entry.
Every business is at different a stage for company size and number of departments; with their own product and process complexities. One data management system does not fit all, so DS SOLIDWORKS have different options to suit your needs for both today and tomorrow.
