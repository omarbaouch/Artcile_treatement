<p>Manufacturers invest heavily in engineering tools, ERP systems, and SOLIDWORKS PDM for product data management. Yet many small and mid-sized businesses still rely on email folders and memory to manage customer relationships. A formal CRM platform keeps the entire organization focused on service, sales growth, and market development.</p>

<h2>Deliver Consistent Customer Service</h2>

<p>Use CRM to capture every implementation milestone, warranty question, and service ticket in one location. When the entire team sees the latest conversations, customers avoid being bounced between departments and issues are resolved before penalties or rework occur. CRM complements ERP and SOLIDWORKS PDM by storing the communication history that explains why technical changes were made.</p>

<h2>Boost Win Rates and Revenue</h2>

<p>Centralize opportunity data so engineering, sales, and operations share the same requirements, RFQ details, and configuration rules. A CRM platform tracks why projects are won or lost and highlights the solutions customers request most often. Those insights inform quoting templates, standard products, and the data you publish through SOLIDWORKS PDM.</p>

<h2>Expand Into New Markets</h2>

<p>Breaking into new territories or industries demands structure. CRM lets you segment prospects, plan outreach, and monitor progress against goals. By coordinating marketing activities and sales follow-up, your team can replicate successful tactics and pivot quickly when new product launches or channel strategies require different messaging.</p>

<h2>Keep the Organization Aligned</h2>

<p>Whether you manage distributors, direct customers, or internal stakeholders, CRM provides visibility into every interaction. Combine it with the technical context stored in SOLIDWORKS PDM and ERP to create a complete view of each accountâ€”and ensure every department contributes to customer satisfaction and growth.</p>
