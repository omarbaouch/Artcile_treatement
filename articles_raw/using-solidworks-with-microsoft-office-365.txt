DS SOLIDWORKS does not officially support the use of
Microsoft Office 365
and similar outsourced mail servers. SOLIDWORKS does provide a Knowledgeable article that offers a possible workaround. This article contains a link to a utility for creating a
E-MailRelay
, as well as a PDF containing general instructions on using this utility.
NOTE
: This utility is not a purpose-built SOLIDWORKS PDM solution and implementing it does require knowledge of email server structures.
Implementing the relay is something that should be done by your company IT department. Further,
the use of this utility is not guaranteed by SOLIDWORKS
. It is up to the individual organization to implement and test this solution. Your SOLIDWORKS Value Added Reseller should be able to point you to the Knowledge base article mentioned in this blog.
