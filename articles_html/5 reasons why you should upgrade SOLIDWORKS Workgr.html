<p>If you are currently managing your projects with SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDM (WPDM) but need to expand your system to accommodate users outside of your organization, connect with other business systems, or require a more advanced document workflow then you will need to upgrade to SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional (formerly Enterprise PDM).</p>
<p>Here are five good reasons why you should upgrade SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDM to SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional:</p>
<h2>1. Provide access to ALL departments in your business</h2>
<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional uses a native Windows Explorer-based interface which provides you with the ability to manage access to all your data by other departments — such as marketing, purchasing, and manufacturing. Processes with other departments that typically occur sequentially can now take place in parallel, further boosting your business productivity and speeding time-to-market.</p>
<div id="attachment_11764" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11764" class="wp-image-11764 size-full lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/epdm-windows-explorer.jpg" alt="SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional Windows Explorer" width="1000" height="666" title=""><p id="caption-attachment-11764" class="wp-caption-text"><noscript><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-11764 size-full lazyload" src="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/epdm-windows-explorer.jpg" alt="SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional Windows Explorer" width="1000" height="666" title="" srcset="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/epdm-windows-explorer.jpg 1000w, https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/epdm-windows-explorer-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/epdm-windows-explorer-640x426.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></noscript> SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional Windows Explorer</p></div>
<p>For instance marketing can access photorealistic renderings to conduct field research, produce brochures, and create web pages much earlier in the process. Purchasing can access drawing files to solicit quotes for components, materials, and services more quickly, while manufacturing can access BOMs and complete production planning more efficiently.</p>
<p>With a SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional Vault you can replicate portions to different servers, or provide a secure web access to design data at the user level. This enables product development organizations to support collaboration anywhere in the world.</p>
<h2>2. Connect ALL your business systems</h2>
<p>Connecting your PDM system with your existing business applications, such as material resource planning (MRP) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, can provide additional operational efficiencies, eliminate duplicated efforts, and further reduce the potential for errors. The open system architecture of SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional, utilizing Microsoft SQL Server™ and its own standards-based, comprehensive (com, Visual Basic®, C+®) application programming interface (API), will enable you to integrate with other business systems, such as SAP or Microsoft Dynamics. Javelin’s team of SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional implementation experts will be able to set that up for you.</p>

<h2>3. Implement better workflow in your business</h2>
<p>With SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional you can easily set-up an automated workflow. The system ensures that all employees adhere to a company’s own designated process, and SolidWorks Enterprise PDM provides the tools for defining and formalizing the organization’s approach to developing products.</p>
<p>The workflow functions of SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional enable users and personnel at local and distributed locations to become active participants in product development, design reviews, engineering change orders, quote approvals, and other product development-related processes.</p>

<h2>4. Easily find and reuse design data</h2>
<p>The intelligent search capabilities of SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional makes it easy to find design information based on file names, contained data, attached metadata, workflow state, or other predefined search characteristics. SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional facilitates design reuse by enabling you to classify, organize, and group design information for quick search and retrieval. By assigning specific searchable attributes for every file, project, and product design on individual system data cards; all departments can find and access any piece of design information they may need.</p>
<p>Moving to SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional will provide much greater scalability as the searching and file operations can be handled by separate servers. Plus the software offers remote file storage and replication to allow fast access to files in other locations throughout your wide area network (WAN).</p>

<h2>5. A better system for ISO Compliancy</h2>
<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional automatically captures a complete, accurate, and detailed audit trail—from start to finish—for every product, assembly, and component your business will develop. Creating an audit trail will help you to meet regulations, such as International Standards Organization (ISO).</p>
