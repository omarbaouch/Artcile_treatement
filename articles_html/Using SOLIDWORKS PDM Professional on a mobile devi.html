<p>I recently came across this video created by DS SOLIDWORKS Senior Technical Manager Steve Fick.  Steve did a great job touching on two very important advantages of the <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2015/10/solidworks-pdm-standard-and-professional-comparison/">SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional version over the standard version</a> to 1) ensure that a distributed and mobile team can access data quickly and reliably, and 2) having the ability to make good decisions while on the road.</p>

<h3>PDM Web Portal</h3>
<p>The key focus is on the <strong>web portal available with SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional</strong> and how easy it is to navigate with a mobile phone as it automatically detects and switches to an optimized format.  It also <strong>integrates seamlessly with the eDrawings IOS or Android app</strong> which allows managers to review the actual CAD data while on the run.</p>
<h5>Take a look at the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional mobile device demonstration below:</h5>
<div class="oembed"><iframe title="SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional on an iPhone" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTthESNRy5Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The nice thing about this web portal is that it doesn&#8217;t require any additional PDM licensing.  It consumes the same PDM licenses that designers and managers use while at their desks.  We have set up a good number of clients with this web portal already.</p>
