New in
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019
, when you add new sheets to a checked-out SOLIDWORKS drawing file, SOLIDWORKS PDM generates default values for the newly added sheets and updates the values in the drawing data card.
Previously, you had to manually update the values of mandatory variables in the drawing data card before check-in.

In the
Administration
tool, in the
SOLIDWORKS Drawing Card
, if you select the
