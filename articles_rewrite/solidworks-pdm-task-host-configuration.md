<p>Automation tasks in SOLIDWORKS PDM only run on computers that are explicitly authorized. Before scheduling print jobs, conversions, or custom add-in actions, verify the Task Host Configuration for each workstation.</p>

<h2>Open the Task Host Configuration</h2>

<p>On the workstation that will execute tasks, right-click the SOLIDWORKS PDM icon in the Windows system tray. Choose <strong>Task Host Configuration</strong> from the menu.</p>

<h2>Select Vaults and Add-ins</h2>

<p>In the Task Host Configuration dialog, pick the correct file vault and enable the add-ins that should run on this machineâ€”such as PDF publishing, SOLIDWORKS tasks, or custom automation.</p>

<h2>Keep Automation Reliable</h2>

<p>Review these settings whenever you add a new vault, deploy a workstation, or install updated task add-ins. Ensuring hosts are authorized prevents failed jobs and keeps your SOLIDWORKS PDM data management workflows running smoothly.</p>
