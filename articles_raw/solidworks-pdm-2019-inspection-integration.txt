How does SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019 Inspection Integration improve our vault?
With the updated integration, it’s possible to edit SOLIDWORKS Inspection properties directly from the vault, making it unnecessary to open the inspection program each time, thus cutting down on lost time; making users more efficient.
With all this added to the vault; it helps to make the SOLIDWORKS PDM a ‘One Stop Shop’ for all our engineering files, centralizing all documents in one location and adding the many benefits of PDM…such as permissions, version control, and revision management to inspection files.
