<h3>Finding files is a Pain!</h3>
<p>How often do you find yourself spending valuable time searching for a 3D model or a document? Have you ever had to recreate a model because you could not find the original? Have you ever spent time creating a design only to discover later that there is a similar design that would have met your needs? If you are not using an integrated PDM system, chances are you are feeling this pain!</p>

<h5>Enterprise PDM Stress Relief</h5>
<p>SolidWorks® Enterprise Product Data Management (EPDM) centralizes the storage of all your engineering data and related files to give you the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search for data in multiple ways</strong>, using parameters such as document or file name, contained data, or custom properties like part number, description, and current workflow state (for example, released or in process).</li>
<li><strong>Save searches for easy reuse</strong>, individually or across the enterprise.</li>
<li><strong>Use integrated Windows Explorer search</strong> and browse capabilities to reduce desktop clutter and find files faster.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Is Getting Overwritten!</h3>
<p>What happens once you find the file that you need? How do you make sure that you don&#8217;t overwrite a file or work with the wrong revision? Do personnel outside of engineering—such as manufacturing, purchasing, and field service people require access to design data? How can they view the file they need without accidentally corrupting, deleting, or changing a design?</p>

<h5>Enterprise PDM Stress Relief</h5>
<p>SolidWorks® Enterprise PDM allows for collaboration throughout your organization while keeping people connected, current, and working on the same set of data:</p>

</ul>
<h3>No Data Workflow!</h3>
<p>Do users follow your company&#8217;s designated workflow processes? Or does everyone follow their own individual approach? You may be finding it time consuming and painfully difficult to manage data effectively without automated workflows.</p>
