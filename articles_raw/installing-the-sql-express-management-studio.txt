With the 2019 release and later versions of SOLIDWORKS PDM, the SQL Server Management Studio is no longer included within the installation media.  Please see
here
for our updated guide to downloading and installing the SSMS.
The SQL Server Express Management Studio is a must for any SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard installation.  With this tool you can capture database backups, run queries and complete other vault maintenance.
The simplest way to install this is during install within the installation manger;
At SWPDM Server Options select ‘
Install MS SQL Management Tools
‘;
Install Via Installation Manager
If you missed this during install do not fear as we can complete this later manually.
