Scenarios where this may be useful…
Scenario 1: Upgrading the vault
For a
vault upgrade
, we strongly recommend that all files are checked in, and users are logged out.  Using this search we can ensure all users are logged out before completing the upgrade.
Scenario 2: The license fight
If you’re constantly in a fight for a PDM license so you can access the vault, you can ask one of your fellow colleagues to complete this search and find out who you need to request to log out so you can gain a license. *
*Alternatively, you could recruit your friendly neighborhood VAR and purchase more licenses
