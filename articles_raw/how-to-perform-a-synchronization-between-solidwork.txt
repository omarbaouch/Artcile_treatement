Within
SOLIDWORKS Manage
, there are scenarios (upgrading, etc) where a manual synchronization of the PDM object is required to ensure everything is up to date between SOLIDWORKS Manage and PDM.
How to run a synchronization of a SOLIDWORKS ‘PDM’ object
Within SOLIDWORKS Manage;
Options >
Administrative Options
SOLIDWORKS Manage Administrative Options
Structures > Documents & Records
Select the PDM Object

On some specific occasions, it may be required to include all the PDM documents in a synchronization.  These generally take a lot longer depending on the size of the vault, so should only be performed when necessary.

Enable Synchronization and get all PDM Objects
