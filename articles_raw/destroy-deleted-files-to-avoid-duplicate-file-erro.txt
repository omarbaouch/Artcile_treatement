You attempt to check in a SOLIDWORKS PDM file, but you receive a message that
‘a file with this name already exists in the vault’
. You perform a search and cannot find this file?!
This can happen when a file with the same name has been deleted. Deleting a file in the vault, is similar to deleting a file in Windows Explorer;
the file is moved to a Recycle bin of sorts
. This allows the deleted files to be recovered.
In order to check in the new file, the deleted file must be destroyed. This is done by right clicking on the folder that contained the deleted file and selecting
Properties.
From the
Deleted Items
folder, right-click the deleted file and select
Destroy
.
Note
: You will have to have the required administrative permissions to destroy the file.
Destroy Deleted Files
For subscription customers, SOLIDWORKS offers a report to find deleted files in vault. This report is available from the
DS Support Knowledge Base
.
