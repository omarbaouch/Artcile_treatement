With
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
,
SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard
, and
SQL Management Studio
by default within Microsoft SQL, the recovery model option for any new databases is set to full.  In some instances this can cause problems later as the full recovery model; causes the transaction log to grow exponentially as regular database backups are captured.  We have seen instances in the past where the transaction log continually grows to a point where it’s consumed all the available disk space and causes performance issues within SQL and the vault.  If you are
backing up the vault DB daily
we recommend the recovery model is set to simple, to prevent the transaction log from getting too large.
How to verify and change the Recovery Model option of the DB
Log in to the SQL Server Management Studio using the
sa
(system administrator) account;
Log In to the server
Expand the
Databases
folder
Select the vault DB
Right-click >
Properties
;
Database Properties
Select
Options
and the
Recovery Model
should be listed;
Recovery Model Options
And if necessary, we can switch it from
Full
to
Simple
via the drop-down, then hit
OK
;
Changing the DB Recovery Model to Simple
NOTE
: These recommendations are based on the SOLIDWORKS PDM uses of SQL when regular backups are performed.  More information regarding the Recovery Model and transaction log options can be found within the SQL documentation.
If your Recovery Model has been set to full for some time, and you’d like to clear up some storage space; a shrink of the transaction log may be required.
