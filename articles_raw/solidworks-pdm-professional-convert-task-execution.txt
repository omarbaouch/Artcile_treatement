Within SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional, when creating a
task
after selecting
which computers can support the task
, we have 3 options for the execution method;
Let the system choose the computers to execute the task
Prompt the user to choose a computer when the task is initiated
Execute on the computer where the task is initiated
SOLIDWORKS PDM Task execution Methods
Your environment will define which is the appropriate selection, for example; using a dedicated task host…but what do each of these options mean?
1. Let the system choose the computers to execute the task
This option is available if you have multiple task hosts enabled.  With this selected, there is no hierarchy and whichever available machine responds first will accept the task.
2. Prompt the user to choose a computer when the task is initiated
With this option selected, when the task is launched, the user will be presented with a list of hosts to choose from;
Note: The task will be added to the queue but won’t launch until the client is available
3. Execute on the computer where the task is initiated
This is the only option available with PDM Standard.  This will launch the task on the same machine that created the task.
If you’d like the task to be completed silently when attached to a workflow transition, it is required to select
Let the system choose the computers to execute the task
or
Execute on the computer where the task is initiated
for the execution method
We can monitor what tasks are queued on which machines via the task list in the Administration Tool:
