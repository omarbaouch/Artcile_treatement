When troubleshooting problems within SOLIDWORKS PDM, especially performance issues, it’s important to ensure the client has a strong connection to the server components.  Often, tech support will request an extended ping test, to look for issues.
How to complete an extended ping test with log
In Windows 10
Start button > RMB > Run
CMD
Run CMD
Ping <Database/Archive Server Name> -t -l
1350
>C:\temp\Pingtest.txt
Let it run for a sample amount of time, then stop the test by pressing
CTRL-C
.
The command will be completed, and a log file generated on the C-Drive;
This can then be sent to tech support for further analysis.
Additional Notes
The above test is using an increased packet size of
1350
, this improves the quality of the test to a size more comparable with PDM communications.
Any listings of ‘Request timed out’ or dropped packets would indicate an issue.
If multiple tests are required (network communication can vary) editing the command from ‘>’ to ‘>>’ will append the existing log, rather than replacing it, so multiple tests can be captured within the one log.
2025-06-04…Update Details
This article was updated to reduce the sample packet size from 1500 to 1350 as within some environments a packet size of > 1400 could cause IP fragmentation / reassembly on the link to measure.
