SOLIDWORKS PDM Dispatch
is a very powerful tool in
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
.
However as the number of Dispatch Actions grows, the right-click shortcut menu list can get larger and larger, as shown below:
SOLIDWORKS PDM Dispatch Menu listing is quite large
At this time there is no way to filter out Dispatch Actions so that they only show for some Users or Group, or so that they only display in certain folders.
It is possible though to
organize the Dispatch Actions into sub or fly out menus
in the right-click shortcut menu.
Separate menu items with a backslash
In the Dispatch Action settings, under the Menu Command, the sub menus and command text can be separated using a back slash
.
So
Dispatch\Rename\Rename with Drawing Numbers
will result in a fly out menu named “Dispatch” with a sub fly out menu named “Rename” and finally the command named “Rename with Drawing Numbers” as shown in the figure below;
