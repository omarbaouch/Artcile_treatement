SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard
SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard is the new document management tool that is being released with SOLIDWORKS 2016, it works in a similar manner to SOLIDWORKS Enterprise PDM, which has been renamed to SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional for the 2016 release.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard replaces SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDM, which is set to be discontinued in the 2018 release.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard is included with SOLIDWORKS 2016 Professional and Premium licenses.
PDM Standard is the ideal data management application for single-site SOLIDWORKS businesses that need an easy-to-use solution that can be easily upgraded to SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional when their needs change.

is similar to the Contributor, but only viewing is allowed.
Additional licenses of the Contributor and Viewer, can be purchased in 5-packs.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard licenses
Licenses will be handled by a
SolidNetWork License (SNL) Manager
. This is the same utility that SOLIDWORKS network licenses use. A CAD Editor license will be available for each seat of SOLIDWORKS 2016 Professional and Premium license owned. A serial number will be assigned to each eligible SOLIDWORKS 2016 license.
