In SOLIDWORKS PDM 2018, the much-anticipated
Revision Tables
integration was added, and we can now automatically add table rows with updated variable values via a workflow transition or the
Set Revision
command.  In this article, we’re going to look at the basic set up of this feature to automatically update the Revision Table via a workflow transition action.
NOTE
: This functionality requires SOLIDWORKS PDM 2018 or later, and the drawing file format to be 2018 or later.
How To Set Up Revision Tables
By default, there are 5 revision columns; Zone, Rev, Description, Date and Approved.  For this example, we’re going to create a table that only uses
Rev
,
Description – Rev Table
,
Date
and
Approved
Enable Revision Tables
Administration Tool > SOLIDWORKS > Revision Table
Settings:
Check
Enable Revision Table
Number of visible rows:
3
Revision placeholder character(s): *
Revision Table Settings
Map Variables
Administration Tool > Variables > Revision
Create a new attribute
Block Name:
SWRevTable
Attribute Name:
Revision
Extension:
slddrw
Map Variables
Repeat for variables used for the
Description – Rev Table
,
Date
and
Approved
values.
Integrate Into Workflow
For any transitions that have revision actions associated with them; add
Set Variable
actions to update the variable used by the table
Integrate Into Workflow
For this example, I’m using the
Default
vault set up, therefore this required adding actions to the transitions;
Passed Approval
,
No Approval Required
and
Change Approved
For more information regarding the increment of a revision via a workflow please see our previous article on
SOLIDWORKS PDM Revision
.
Test Thoroughly
This is a great example of something that can be tested thoroughly in a Sandbox vault, ahead of implementing in your production vault.
NOTE
: The drawing must have a pre-existing revision table within it, for the integration to work and the rows to be added automatically.
