In a previous post I showed you how to
reset the ‘default’ SOLIDWORKS PDM Vault Admin Password
. If you’ve ever had the chance to participate in one of my
administering SOLIDWORKS PDM training class
, you’ve likely heard my
rant
lecture on the benefits of a
sandbox vault
.
A Sandbox Vault gives us a place to test and troubleshoot vault issues or changes in a safe place, before implementing any changes in our primary production vault.  This sandbox vault isn’t something we’ll likely be using daily, and with that said; it’s easy to forget the password as we’re maybe not using it often.  I recently had a scenario where I needed to reset the SOLIDWORKS PDM Admin Password, in test vault without affecting my primary vault.
