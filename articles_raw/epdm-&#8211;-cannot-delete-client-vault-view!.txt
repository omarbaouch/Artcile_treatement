If being logged in as the user or an administrator will not allow you remove the view, the problem could be due to the
desktop.ini
file missing or having incorrect “AttachedBy” information.
1. Open a command prompt
2.  Navigate to the local vault view (cd c:\<vault>)
3. Type
desktop.ini
, this will open the desktop.ini file for editing in notepad:
4. Add or update the “AttachedBy” entry and enter your currently logged in windows profile in the syntax of machine name\username.
5.  Save and close the file.
6. Close the command prompt and you should now be able to remove the view without a warning.
