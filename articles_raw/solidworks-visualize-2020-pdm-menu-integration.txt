A great addition in
SOLIDWORKS Visualize 2020
is the new SOLIDWORKS PDM menu.  This menu provides better integration between Visualize and your data management tools.
The menu will become active when a file stored in a
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
vault is opened in Visualize (
this functionality is not currently available for
SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard
).
SOLIDWORKS PDM Menu
Now, directly through the Visualize interface, users can manage files in PDM.  Actions such as Get Version, Check In, Check Out and Change State can be performed through the drop menu.
Version and Transition Comments can be entered directly through the interface without leaving the program.
Version and Transition Comments
Specific file information including, Local Version, Local Revision, Checked Out By, Checked Out In and the current Workflow State are all listed at the bottom of the menu.
Additionally, you can open the file’s Data Card, and view or edit it inside the SOLIDWORKS Visualize program.
