Wrap Up…
Previously, to upload or download a file was a manual process…it had to be completed separately for each file, which made it a tedious process to say the least.  With these new enhancements, time will be saved for external users accessing the vault via Web2, making them more efficient and allowing them to continue their work while offsite or on the road with ease.
