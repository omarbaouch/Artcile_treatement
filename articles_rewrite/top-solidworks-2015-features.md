<p>SOLIDWORKS 2016 was just around the corner when the 2015 release delivered hundreds of improvements across CAD, simulation, and SOLIDWORKS PDM. Subscription Service customers can still benefit from mastering the flagship capabilities introduced in 2015. Start with these ten areas to boost productivity before you move on to newer versions.</p>

<p>Want a quick refresher? Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fPWwvJpxEY">SOLIDWORKS 2015 Enhancements Summary</a> and then dive into the highlights below.</p>

<h2>1. New Product Development Workflows</h2>

<p>Deliver projects faster while meeting industry standards. SOLIDWORKS Model Based Definition (MBD) captures 3D PMI data for downstream consumers, and SOLIDWORKS Treehouse lets you plan assembly structures visually—even exporting models directly to AEC applications.</p>

<h2>2. Integrated Manufacturing Capabilities</h2>

<p>SOLIDWORKS Inspection automates first-article reports, SOLIDWORKS Costing evaluates manufacturing costs across weldments, plastics, castings, and 3D-printed parts, and direct AMF/3MF printing connects your models to additive workflows.</p>

<h2>3. Performance Improvements</h2>

<p>Expect smaller file sizes, faster patterning, and multithreaded contact detection in SOLIDWORKS Simulation. Incremental result viewing accelerates design validation, while SOLIDWORKS Enterprise PDM manages large data sets more efficiently.</p>

<h2>4. Part and Surface Modeling Enhancements</h2>

<p>Sketch more intelligently with midpoint lines and improved rectangle construction lines. Updated pattern tools—Fill, Linear, Chain, and Variable—plus asymmetric fillets and split surfaces make complex geometry easier.</p>

<h2>5. Assembly Productivity</h2>

<p>Advanced mechanical mates center components automatically, routing now supports rectangular sections, and chain component patterns simulate energy chains. New explode options control spacing along axes and radial paths.</p>

<h2>6. Drawing Automation</h2>

<p>Locate views quickly, apply spline-based leaders, control decimal rounding, and generate sheet zone annotations with less manual setup. These tools keep detailing consistent across large drawing packages.</p>

<h2>7. Design Simulation Advances</h2>

<p>Load Case Manager predicts durability under dynamic conditions, nonlinear results can be reviewed during solve, rotating mesh regions improve Flow Simulation accuracy, and SOLIDWORKS Plastics adds venting analysis.</p>

<h2>8. Electrical Design Updates</h2>

<p>Dynamic Connector tools simplify harnesses, enhanced formula management unlocks complex calculations, and 3D routing diagnostics resolve pathway conflicts before manufacturing.</p>

<h2>9. User Experience Upgrades</h2>

<p>Dynamic Reference Visualization illustrates feature dependencies, Selection Sets store commonly used entities, isolate in-context components quickly, and preview hidden geometry from the FeatureManager.</p>
