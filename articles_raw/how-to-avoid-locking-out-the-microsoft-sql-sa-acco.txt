Starting with Microsoft SQL 2005, the Password Policy and Password Lockout settings from the Windows Operating System (found by going to
Control Panel
>
Administrative Tools
>
Local Security Policy
>
Account Policies
) are automatically inherited by the sa account in SQL.
Account Policies
This could lead to issues if the password stored in the
Database Server Configuration
program or the
Archive Server Configuration
tool are incorrect for any reason and the Password Policy is set to lockout the account after a certain number of failed login attempts.
If that happens, PDM will no longer be able to access the SQL database and users will not be able to work in the vault.
For this reason the
SOLIDWORKS PDM Installation Guide
recommends disabling this option for the sa account.
This can be done from within the
SQL Server Management Studio
program, by expanding the
Security
folder, then the
Logins
folder and right clicking the sa account and selecting Properties.
In the Login Properties window, on the General page, clear the option “Enforce password policy”.
Once this change is made there should no longer be any concern about the sa account being locked out because of an incorrect password.
