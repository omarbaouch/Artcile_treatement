<h3>Who should access SOLIDWORKS PDM Online?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>shop floor</strong> to start. Quite often, the shop floor gets the main office hand me down computers. So they may not have the system requirements to run a current operating system. Or at the other end of the spectrum, you may have more mobile solutions like tablets that don’t run a Windows operating system at all.</li>
<li><strong>Sales teams</strong> who are out of the office would benefit by having access to the latest data.</li>
<li><strong>Service teams</strong> that are on the road who may need access to current repair procedures. Or, what if they could communicate back any issues they’ve found, immediately with photos from their smartphone.</li>
<li><strong>Managers or clients</strong> may need to review or approve the design drawings. Wouldn’t it be more productive if they had access to the vaulted data and be able to keep the process moving efficiently no matter where they might be?</li>
</ul>
