If your
SOLIDWORKS Toolbox
is stored within the vault, you have the option to
manually upgrade it
, or my preferred method is to use the Installation Manager as I’ve outlined here:
How to upgrade SOLIDWORKS Toolbox using the Installation Manager
In this scenario, the upgrade is complete on the server using the
PDM Upgrade Checklist.
Now, we’re finally ready to upgrade SOLIDWORKS and PDM Client to the new major version.
NOTE
: SOLIDWORKS Toolbox only needs to be upgraded once, so we’re going to include it in the first SOLIDWORKS workstation being upgraded, the rest will be able to update SOLIDWORKS and PDM at the same time and the toolbox will be skipped.
Preparing the toolbox for upgrading
Log in to the vault, preferably as ‘Admin’ but any account with full permissions will suffice
Logged in as Admin
Perform a ‘Get Latest’ on the toolbox folder to cache the most up to date version of all the files
Get Latest on the Toolbox folder
Check out the database file
Default Location;
[Vault Name]\[Toolbox Path]\lang\english\swbrowser.sldedb
Check out the database file
Completing the upgrade
Start the installation manager, and complete the SOLIDWORKS upgrade with the appropriate settings.
On the Summary Tab
Toolbox/Hole Wizard Options > Select

Complete the upgrade then check in the swbrowser.sldedb file
Validation

Additional Steps
Prior to upgrading any additional SOLIDWORKS workstations to the new version,
perform a Get Latest on the Toolbox folder
, then the latest version will be cached and the installation manager will skip the Toolbox upgrade on those machines.
