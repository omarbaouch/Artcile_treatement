<p>New in <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/tag/solidworks-pdm-2020/">SOLIDWORKS PDM 2020</a>, when performing a complete search, you can now use Search Operators and Wildcards such as “AND”, “OR”, or “NOT” separated by a space.</p>
<p>From previous releases, we know that you can refine your search using various parameters including file name, description, etc. But, what if you don’t know <i>EXACTLY </i>what you’re looking for? That’s why we have wildcards.</p>
<h3>List of Search Operators &amp; Wildcards:</h3>
<pre>*     -&gt; Default search Method 

" "   -&gt; Exact Entry

=     -&gt; Exact Entry

&lt;     -&gt; Less than a particular number

&gt;     -&gt; Greater than a particular  number

&lt;=    -&gt; Less than or equal to a particular number

&gt;=    -&gt; Greater than or equal to a particular number

SPACE -&gt; Equivalent to an AND

!=    -&gt; Do not include Entry

<span style="color: #ff6600;">AND   -&gt; String containing "Value1 AND Value2"

&amp;     -&gt; String containing "Value1 &amp; Value2"</span>

<span style="color: #ff6600;">OR    -&gt; Equivalent to "Value1 OR Value2" 

|     -&gt; Equivalent to OR "Value1 | Value2" </span>

<span style="color: #ff6600;">NOT   -&gt; Do not include Entry "NOT Document"</span></pre>
<p>Given the list of Wildcards above, keep in mind that there are a few rules that one needs to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search strings are case sensitive.</li>
<li>Operators such as “AND OR and NOT” are case sensitive and need to be capital separated by a space.</li>
<li>To search for special characters in a name, use “\” as a workaround
<ul>
<li>Example: File Name – ‘Tool &amp; Die’</li>
<li>Search Field: “Tool \&amp;”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
