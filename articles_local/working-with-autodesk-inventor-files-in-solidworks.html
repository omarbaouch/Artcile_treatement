<p>In order for Autodesk Inventor files to be managed in SOLIDWORKS PDM, the client system needs to have either the full Inventor application or the Inventor Viewer installed. The reason for this, is that the Inventor files are read/written to, using the Inventor API.</p>
<p>The Inventor viewer, <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor-products/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-inventor-view-2018.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Inventor View</a>, can be downloaded from the Autodesk web site. Inventor View is NOT required to preview files .iam and ipt Inventor files, in the Local Vault View. The 3D Interconnect functionality built into eDrawings, will accommodate these file types.</p>

<h2>About SOLIDWORKS 3D Interconnect</h2>
<p>SOLIDWORKS 3D Interconnect delivers groundbreaking capabilities for working with both neutral and native CAD data from various sources, unlocking powerful workflows for you to collaborate with customers and vendors. With 3D Interconnect you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain direct integration of native CAD files from PTC<sup>® </sup>Creo<sup>®</sup>, Autodesk<sup>®</sup> Inventor<sup>®</sup>, Siemens<sup>®</sup> NX, Solid Edge<sup>®</sup>, and CATIA<sup>®</sup>, and treat them like native components.</li>
<li>Avoid fixing errors or problems due to SOLIDWORKS awareness of all components in the native CAD files, like face and edge IDs.</li>
<li>Directly open imported files and treat them like Base Parts, so you can freely make design modifications without affecting the native file.</li>
<li>Update both part and assembly files as design changes take place with Update Model feature.</li>
</ul>
