A question I run into often while on tech support is:
“Why is the SOLIDWORKS PDM
Update Variable
checkbox greyed out when using the
Set Revision tool
?”
Set Revision – Update Variable Greyed Out
The minimum permissions required to use
Set Revision
are;
Folder Permission
Set Revision
State Permission
Set Revision
But to also update the variable will require;
Folder Permission
Check out file
State Permission
Check out file
Set Revision – Update Variable – Required Permissions
With the
Check out file
permission added, you’ll be able to also update the variable when using
Set Revision
;
Set Revision
If you’re of the mindset that the
Check out file
permissions shouldn’t be necessary to update the variable, you’re not alone.  There’s an existing enhancement request to have this requirement removed;
SPR# 898366
: ‘Set Revision’ feature should not require ‘Check Out File’ permission to increment revision without update to variable (data card).
If this sounds appealing, you can vote on this via the
