<p>Product designs evolve quickly, and keeping proprietary information under control is critical. Dassault Systèmes offers two distinct data management ecosystems—SOLIDWORKS PDM and the 3DEXPERIENCE platform—each engineered for different deployment models and user experiences. This technical comparison walks through the practical differences so you can match the right solution to your infrastructure, processes, and collaboration requirements.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM installs on Windows servers that you own or host through providers such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. Whether the server is on-premises or in a private cloud, your IT team is responsible for provisioning hardware, applying updates, and maintaining connectivity—often through VPN access when users are remote.</p>

<p>The 3DEXPERIENCE On the Cloud offer is fully hosted by Dassault Systèmes and accessed through secure web standards. Because everything runs in the browser, users can review data from any operating system, while native CAD connectors are deployed on supported Windows machines when authoring content.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>End users work with SOLIDWORKS PDM inside Windows File Explorer, which keeps the interface familiar for SOLIDWORKS designers and other contributors. Add-ins extend that environment to SOLIDWORKS Visualize, SOLIDWORKS Inspection, SOLIDWORKS Electrical, and even third-party applications such as Microsoft Office, DraftSight, and Inventor. Remote teams can use the browser-based <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2021/05/how-to-access-your-solidworks-pdm-vault-online/">SOLIDWORKS PDM Web2 client</a> to preview, print, and participate in workflow approvals without the desktop client.</p>

</figure>

<p>The 3DEXPERIENCE platform is entirely browser-driven, so teams on Windows, macOS, or Linux can visualize models, manage lifecycles, and build dashboards tailored to their role. The dashboard approach is more flexible than traditional File Explorer views, though it requires a short learning curve for users steeped in decades of Windows conventions. CAD connectors support SOLIDWORKS, CATIA, DraftSight, Inventor, AutoCAD, Altium, and other mainstream tools, and publishing data to the cloud happens through the authoring application running on Windows.</p>

<h2>Licenses</h2>

<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM relies on concurrent network licenses. A shared pool serves all users, releasing seats when people log out, so you can purchase viewer or contributor licenses at ratios lower than 1:1.</p>

<p>The 3DEXPERIENCE platform follows a SaaS model with named users. <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2020/10/3dexperience-works-named-user-licensing/">Each user is explicitly assigned roles</a>, which remain with that user for 30 days before they can be reassigned. Beginning with 2025x FD01, the SOLIDWORKS CAD role can be freed after one day, but most other roles maintain the 30-day allocation window.</p>

<h2>Searching</h2>

<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM provides a configurable search interface tailored by administrators. Criteria can span authorship, lifecycle status, file properties, and other metadata, helping users zero in on exactly the right revision.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img src="/assets/images/SOLIDWORKS-PDM-Search-600x260.png" alt="SOLIDWORKS PDM Search" width="600" height="260" />
  <figcaption>The dedicated SOLIDWORKS PDM search tool filters results by metadata.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>3DEXPERIENCE embraces a broader search paradigm. Users can start with a global query across CAD, documents, and collaborative objects, then refine results using 6WTags to answer the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and hoW of the data. Organizations can supplement the standard tags with custom attributes to align with their governance model.</p>

</figure>

<h2>Data Cards</h2>

<p>Within SOLIDWORKS PDM, customizable data cards present the most relevant fields to each user. Administrators can link cards to PDM variables or SOLIDWORKS custom properties, lock fields when required, and show or hide controls based on prior selections for guided data entry.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter">

  <figcaption>Data cards in SOLIDWORKS PDM display tailored file properties.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The 3DEXPERIENCE Information Pane is largely out of the box. It surfaces attributes, relationships, derived outputs, attachments, and specification documents in a consistent format based on object type, giving teams quick access to contextual data.</p>

<h2>Versions and Revisions</h2>

<p>Every SOLIDWORKS PDM check-in creates a new version, preserving a chronological history that you can roll back to at any time. Version numbers increment from 1 and cannot be customized.</p>

<p>Revisions in SOLIDWORKS PDM mark formal releases and can follow any scheme—automatic, list-driven, or manual—with major/minor levels to match departmental needs. For example, version 11 may correspond to revision A while later versions still track in parallel.</p>

  <figcaption>SOLIDWORKS PDM history reveals both version checkpoints and released revisions.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The 3DEXPERIENCE platform handles maturity differently. Revision schemes are limited to letters, numbers, or combinations such as A.1, A.2, B.1, etc., and every object begins in an “In Work” state. Promotions to “Released” depend on the maturity graph and the user’s role within the collaborative space. Once released, a new revision must be created before edits continue.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM workflows govern visibility, permissions, and automation. Multiple workflows accommodate everything from straightforward library approvals to complex engineering release processes. Automation steps—like generating PDF or STEP deliverables—can run at specific transitions to keep downstream teams informed.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter">

  <figcaption>Complex workflows in SOLIDWORKS PDM coordinate reviews and output generation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>3DEXPERIENCE relies on maturity states to control edit access, with optional routes and change actions providing deeper approvals. Many companies start with the out-of-the-box maturity graph and layer in more sophisticated routes over time. A Business Process Management role planned for release later in 2025 will expand automation options for organization-wide orchestration.</p>

<h2>File References</h2>

<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM tracks upstream and downstream references directly inside File Explorer. Designers can review configurations, versions, and where-used data, or create custom links to supporting documents such as change requests and emails so everything lives in one vault.</p>

<p>3DEXPERIENCE offers similar traceability through the Relations app, accessible from both CAD connectors and the web interface. Understanding these relationships is essential when planning migrations or coordinating parallel projects.</p>

<h2>Bills of Materials</h2>

<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM publishes CAD “as-built” BOMs derived from SOLIDWORKS assemblies and drawings. Users can switch between drawing BOM views, compare variations, and export lists to CSV or XML. For advanced manufacturing BOM control, tools like SOLIDWORKS Manage or <a href="https://trimech.com/trimech-power-suite-for-solidworks-pdm/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TriMech’s Powersuite for SOLIDWORKS PDM</a> bridge data to MRP and ERP platforms.</p>

<p>On 3DEXPERIENCE, the Product Explorer app provides an immediate view of BOM structures. Optional roles, such as Product Release Engineer, extend capabilities to modify EBOMs and connect them to MBOMs. Because BOMs mirror the CAD feature tree in real time, many teams eliminate external exports to maintain a single source of truth.</p>

<h2>Preview, Review, and Markup</h2>

<p>Inside SOLIDWORKS PDM, the embedded eDrawings viewer lets any user preview vaulted files, take measurements, section models, and capture markups. Annotated feedback can be saved back into the vault and related to the affected items.</p>

<p>3DEXPERIENCE provides a suite of web viewers for measurement, markup, and issue tracking. The Share and Markup feature is particularly useful for early collaboration: designers push a button in SOLIDWORKS to generate a secure link where stakeholders can review and comment without installing local software.</p>

  <figcaption>Share and Markup delivers lightweight review tools to external collaborators.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Engineering Change</h2>

<p>Engineering change processes in SOLIDWORKS PDM revolve around document control. Templates create Word or Excel forms populated with vault metadata, and those records stay linked to the affected CAD files throughout the approval cycle.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img src="/assets/images/SOLIDWORKS-PDM-EC-Doc-600x100.png" alt="SOLIDWORKS PDM Engineering Change document" width="600" height="100" />
  <figcaption>Templates streamline engineering change documentation in SOLIDWORKS PDM.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>3DEXPERIENCE encourages a progressive approach: teams start by managing permissions with maturity states, then incorporate issues, markups, and eventually formal change actions or routes to capture every decision. These capabilities are available out of the box and scale with organizational maturity.</p>

<h2>Compare</h2>

<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM compares metadata-rich artifacts such as BOMs, file properties, and reference structures. Diving into model geometry requires SOLIDWORKS Compare or other third-party viewers configured for individual users.</p>

<p>3DEXPERIENCE automatically generates lightweight visualization data during save operations. Users can compare revisions or assemblies entirely in the browser to spot geometric and BOM differences without launching a desktop CAD tool.</p>
