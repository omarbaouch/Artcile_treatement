When a revision is incremented a label is added to the current version using a predefined revision scheme. The revision can be incremented through a transition action of a workflow, or from the Modify pull-down menu of the local vault view as shown in the figure below.
Modify Increment Revision
This command is also available from the right mouse menu, if you set up the EPDM Admin action shown in the figure below.
Transition action
When the revision is incremented by a transition action, or by manually entering a value in the data card, the associated variable is updated with the new value. When using Modify/Right Mouse Increment Revision, the variable is not updated. The result is that a file’s data card will not show the incremented revision value.
It is best to let the revision be controlled by a transition action
. If Modify/Right Mouse Increment Revision needs to be used, the incremented revision value should be entered manually into the data card.
