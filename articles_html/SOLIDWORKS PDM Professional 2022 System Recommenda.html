<h3>What is the recommended system architecture for SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2022 servers?</h3>
<p>For medium and large PDM Vaults, It is recommended that a separate, dedicated server be used for the <strong>PDM</strong> <strong>Database Server</strong>.  For performance reasons no other databases should be hosted on the same server that is hosting the PDM database.  It is recommended that the SOLIDWORKS PDM Database Server Service (also called the Database Helper service) be installed on the same system that is hosting the SQL Server software.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: It is strongly recommended that the Microsoft SQL Server software not be installed on a system that acts as an Active Directory Domain Controller, this can lead to several known issues, including security risks.</p></blockquote>
<p>A separate server should be used for the SOLIDWORKS PDM Archive Server service.  That same server can also be used for the PDM Web2 Server software.</p>
<h3>What are the minimum hardware requirements for SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2022?</h3>
<p>The minimum requirements can be found on the <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/SystemRequirements.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SOLIDWORKS System Requirements</a> page.</p>
<h3>What Processor (CPU) is recommended for SOLIDWORKS PDM  Professional 2022?</h3>
<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM supports both Intel and AMD processors.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Database Server</strong>, Microsoft SQL can take advantage of multi core processing.  For optimal performance of PDM functions, it is recommended that the average CPU utilization be kept below 50%.  If average utilization is above 50%, then more cores may be needed.  Please note, If using Microsoft SQL Server Standard Core Licensing, adding additional cores may require also purchasing additional core licenses.  This can be discussed with your Microsoft retailer.</p>
<p>For the Archive Server and Web2 Server components the CPU requirements are much lower.</p>
<h3>What Operating System is recommended for SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2022 server components?</h3>
<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM 2022 is officially supported on the following operating systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Server 2016 (SOLIDWORKS PDM 2023 SP5 will be the last release of SOLIDWORKS PDM that will install on Windows Server 2016)</li>
<li>Windows Server 2019 (recommended)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  Windows Server 2012 &amp; Windows Server 2012R2 are NOT compatible with SOLIDWORKS PDM 2022.  As of the Service Pack 0 release, Windows Server 2022 compatibility has not yet been announced.</p></blockquote>
<h3>What Operating System is recommended for SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2022 clients?</h3>
<p>As of the Service Pack 0 release, SOLIDWORKS PDM 2022 can only be installed on Windows 10, compatibility with Windows 11 may be announced with future service packs.   SOLIDWORKS PDM 2020 SP5 was the last release compatible with Windows 7. SOLIDWORKS PDM 2022 will not install on Windows 7.</p>
<h3>Does SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2022 work in virtual environments?</h3>
<p>Yes, however SOLIDWORKS only tests and supports PDM in specific virtual environments. <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/11168_ENU_HTML.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A list of the currently supported virtual environments can be found on the SOLIDWORKS website</a></p>
<h3>Can SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2022 be hosted in the Cloud?</h3>
<p>Although SOLIDWORKS does not test PDM in any cloud provider (please see the note regarding non-supported environments bellow), cloud based servers running Windows Server Operating Systems, such as AWS EC2 or Microsoft Azure, can be used for SOLIDWORKS PDM servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/3d/process/javelin-cloud-services/">Javelin offers various PDM cloud based solutions</a> for customers who are interested in moving their data management to this environment.</p>
<p>If you are investigating your own cloud environment, please take note of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Web Service’s Relational Database Services (RDS) is not an appropriate option for hosting PDM databases as it does not allow using a db_owner This leads to several issues when using PDM.</li>
<li>The runtime restricted license of Microsoft SQL Standard 2014 that was bundled with SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional licenses purchased before Fall 2019, cannot be used for cloud based environments. For a cloud based SQL installation, you will need to ensure that you have an SQL Server license with Software Assurance, or use a EC2 or Azure instance that includes the appropriate licensing.</li>
<li>The latency between the clients to the cloud server must be under 100 milliseconds to prevent issues, best performance will be achieved if latency is below 50 milliseconds. Keep this in mind when selecting your Availability Zone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What version and release of Microsoft SQL Server is recommended for SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2022?</h3>
<p>The following releases of Microsoft SQL Server can be used to host PDM Professional 2022 file vault databases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (SOLIDWORKS PDM 2023 SP5 will be the last release to be compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2016)</li>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server 2017</li>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (Recommended)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  SOLIDWORKS PDM 2022 is not compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2014 (SOLIDWORKS PDM 2021 SP5 was the last release that was compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2014)</p></blockquote>
<p>The database can be hosted on SQL Server Standard or SQL Server Enterprise, however due to performance limitations SQL Express should not be used to host a SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional vault database in a production environment.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  Ensure that you have the proper licensing for the version of SQL that you use for PDM Professional (your Microsoft Software Provider can help you determine if you have all the licenses needed for SQL).</p></blockquote>
<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM 2022 requires Microsoft ODBC drive 17.3 or later for SQL Server to be installed on the Database Server and the Clients.</p>
<h3>How much Memory (RAM) is recommended for SOLIDWORKS PDM 202?</h3>
<p>16GB is recommended for Archive Servers.  For the Database server, a minimum of 32GB is recommended, however this should be increased if necessary.  For optimal performance, there should be at least enough RAM fully cache the database files into the memory, plus an additional 4GB for the Operating System and other services.</p>
<h3>What storage options are recommended for SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2022?</h3>
<p>For PDM Archive storage, a hard drive with fast I/O speeds should be used, ideally a Solid State Drive.  Remote disks, such as a UNC share, NAS or SAN are NOT recommended for storing PDM Archives as there are known performance issues with such environments.  Additionally, SAN and NAS devices are not officially supported by SOLIDWORKS.</p>
<p>For the Microsoft SQL Server, it is recommended that the Windows Server OS (with the SQL software installation), database files (.mdf) and log files (.ldf) should each be separated to individual RAID 1 arrays using high speed Solid State Drives.</p>
<h3>What are the network considerations for SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2022?</h3>
<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Client and Server components must be able to communicate on the following ports:</p>
<h4>Client and Database Server:</h4>
<ul>
<li>TCP 1433</li>
<li>UDP 1434</li>
</ul>
<h4>Client and Archive Server:</h4>
<ul>
<li>TCP 3030</li>
<li>UDP 3030</li>
</ul>
<h4>Client and SolidNetWork License Server:</h4>
<ul>
<li>TCP 25734</li>
<li>UDP 25735</li>
</ul>
<p>If a firewall is in place between the Client systems and the Servers, exceptions must be added for these ports.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  These are the default ports used when the server components are installed however these can be changed through adjustments to the settings so always verify which ports your server components are using when creating any firewall exceptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>As of the 2020 release, SOLIDWORKS PDM no longer utilizes Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0, allowing it to be disabled if necessary.  However, <strong>all previous releases of SOLIDWORKS PDM (2019 and older) require TLS 1.0</strong> to be enabled.</p>
<p>For remote, replicated sites, or cloud based server deployments, network latency between the clients and the Database Server must be less than 100 milliseconds (ms).  Latency above 100ms will lead to severe performance degradation, and above 200ms will result in timeout errors for most PDM functions.  Optimal client performance in a WAN environment will be achieved if the latency between the clients and the SQL Database Server is less than 50 milliseconds.</p>
<h3>Which releases of SOLIDWORKS are compatible with SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2022?</h3>
<p>The PDM Professional 2022 Add In for SOLIDWORKS is tested and fully supported for use with SOLIDWORKS 2022, 2021 and 2020.  While combinations of PDM Professional 2022 and older versions of SOLIDWORKS such as 2019 or 2018 may work, please note that they are not officially tested by SOLIDWORKS Development and so they are not fully supported combinations.</p>
<p>A newer release of SOLIDWORKS is never supported with a previous release of PDM (for instance, SOLIDWORKS 2022 is not compatible with SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2021).</p>
<p>Starting with their 2019 releases, <a href="https://blogs.solidworks.com/solidworksblog/2018/09/whats-new-in-solidworks-composer-2019.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SOLIDWORKS Composer</a> and <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2018/09/solidworks-pdm-2019-inspection-integration/">SOLIDWORKS Inspection Standalone</a> both include PDM Integration built into their menus.  Starting in 2020, <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2020/01/solidworks-visualize-2020-pdm-menu-integration/">SOLIDWORKS Visualize also includes this integration</a>.</p>
