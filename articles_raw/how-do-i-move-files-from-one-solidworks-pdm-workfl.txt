A question I often come across while on tech support is:
How do I move files from one SOLIDWORKS PDM workflow to another?
When a new SOLIDWORKS PDM workflow has been created and additional logic and transitions or states added. There is a need to move many existing files over to the new workflow, the following steps are recommended:
Right-Click in the open area of the old workflow and select “New Workflow Link”
New Workflow Link
Select the Workflow Link Properties, new workflow where the files will be moved and the state files need to be moved to
Workflow Link Properties
Add a transition from current state of the files to the “New Workflow Link” and assign permissions to users/groups to access the new transition and save the workflow
SOLIDWORKS PDM workflow New Transition/Permissions
Right-Click on the file, select Move to Customer Parts Workflow under State Change
Move to New Workflow
Press OK to change the workflow
Transition the files to the New Workflow
Files are in the new workflow/state
Files updated
NOTE
: Validate any workflow changes in a test environment BEFORE making any such global changes in a live production system.
