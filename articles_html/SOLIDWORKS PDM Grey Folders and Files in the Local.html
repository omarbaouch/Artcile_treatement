<p>On occasion I get asked &#8220;why are there <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/3d/technology/solidworks-pdm/">SOLIDWORKS PDM</a> Grey Folders or files in the Local Vault View?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A grey folder or file is located in the cache of the Local Vault View</strong>, but is not present in the Archive vault. Here are reasons why grey folders or files would be present in your local vault view:</p>
<ul>
<li>The folder or file has been deleted, or renamed on a different client</li>
<li>The logged in user lacks the permissions to see the folder or file, but a user with sufficient permissions has previously cached the folder or file locally.</li>
<li>The file was added to the Local Vault view, while in offline mode.</li>
<li>An error occurred while the file was being added to the vault.</li>
<li>The user setting  <strong>Show only local files</strong> is checked.</li>
</ul>
