<p>While helping a customer with an issue they were having with their SOLIDWORKS PDM serial numbers, I came across an article on how unused serial numbers are handled. This article really helped me understand the way serial numbers are doled out and I believe others will find this information useful.</p>
<p>In this article, I have summarized that information. I would encourage you to read the full article which is available from the SOLIDWORKS Knowledgebase.</p>
<p>As those who have implemented and/or administered SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional likely know, PDM Professional includes a serial number generator.</p>

<p>A serial number is a counter that will increment by one, each time it is used. Serial numbers are assigned to file by means such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SOLIDWORKS add-in, if the option is enabled</li>
<li>A control in a data card</li>
<li>Through the use of a PDM template</li>
<li>An option in Copy-Tree</li>
<li>Through a call in an API (application programming interface)</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how the serial number gets pulled, that serial number will be reserved in the SQL database. For the most part, this shouldnâ€™t cause issues, but this can occasionally result in behavior that can cause confusion.</p>
<p>A case study created by SOLIDWORKS Support to illustrate this behavior uses as an example of a PDM template that generates a serial number.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_50284" style="width: 797px"><img alt="" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50284" height="484" src="/assets/images/20-11-2020-02-10-32.png" title="" width="787"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-50284"><noscript><img alt="" height="484" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" src="/assets/images/20-11-2020-02-10-32.png" title="" width="787"/></noscript> Serial Numbers in a PDM Template</p></div>
<p>When a user runs the PDM template, the template generates a serial number (DRW-100) and this serial number is reserved. While this user continues to work in a template, another user creates a couple of new components through the Template. These components get assigned the next available serial numbers, which are DRW-101 and DRW-102. The first user then decides to cancel the template creation. Even though no file was created the serial number DRW-100 is still reserved in the database. If the second user were to then create a third component, that component would get the reserved serial number (DRW-100), not DRW-103. This will continue as long as there are reserved serial numbers. When all reserved serial numbers are used, the next counter value will be used.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_50285" style="width: 517px"><img alt="" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50285" height="293" src="/assets/images/20-11-2020-02-32-04.png" title="" width="507"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-50285"><noscript><img alt="" height="293" src="/assets/images/20-11-2020-02-32-04.png" title="" width="507"/></noscript> Next Counter Value</p></div>
<p>Because these reserved values are lower than the values previously generated by the second user, that user may mistakenly believe that serial numbers are not being generated incorrectly.</p>
