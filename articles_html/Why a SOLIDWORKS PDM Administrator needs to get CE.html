<h2>New SOLIDWORKS PDM Certification Exam</h2>
<p>In 2012 SOLIDWORKS introduced a new certification exam specifically for PDM Administrators.  The<a href="http://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/27510_ENU_HTML.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> Certified PDM Professional Administrator</a> examination is a challenging 2 hour exam that tests the ability of a PDM Administrator to perform both the common, everyday tasks required to maintain and modify a vault for their organization; as well as their ability to handle potential issues that may crop up.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In my opinion this is one of the best crafted exams I&#8217;ve encountered, focusing on very realistic situations that a PDM Administrator will very likely encounter.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>For customers with a current SOLIDWORKS Subscription, this exam is offered for FREE </strong>along with the <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2012/04/free-certification-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSWP Offers for Subscription Service Customers</a>.</p>
<h3>Why do you need to get PDM certified?</h3>
<p>SOLIDWORKS Certifications are an industry recognized achievement that shows your ability to use and manage these tools properly.</p>

<h4>Determine your strengths and weaknesses</h4>
<p>Certification also helps you determine your strengths and your weaknesses.  Studying and preparing for certification is a challenging process, and may help to fill gaps in your knowledge that you didn&#8217;t even realize existed.  SOLIDWORKS has prepared a <a href="http://www.solidworks.com/sw/docs/CEPA_Description_And_Sample_Exam.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sample Exam</a> for the CPPA test as a study guide for those preparing to take the exam.</p>
