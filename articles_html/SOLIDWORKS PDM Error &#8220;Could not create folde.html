<p>This article is part of a series for troubleshooting common, and perhaps not so common, SOLIDWORKS PDM error messages.</p>
<blockquote><p>SOLIDWORKS PDM ERROR: <em>&#8220;Could not create folder. Cause: The file/key name was invalid.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote>
<p>This reported error can occur when executing a SOLIDWORKS PDM Template. <strong>The error is caused when a folder/file name being defined in the SOLIDWORKS PDM Template contains an invalid character</strong>. Later versions of SOLIDWORKS PDM will capture the invalid character, and prevent it from being used in the folder/file name</p>

<p>If the Template was created in an earlier version of SOLIDWORKS PDM, an invalid character may exist in the folder/file name defined in the PDM Template. In this situation, a user will receive the message &#8220;Could not create folder. Cause: The file/key name was invalid.&#8221;Â  when executing the PDM Template. Editing the PDM Template and removing the invalid character will resolve this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Invalid characters</strong> for folder/file names include:</p>
<pre>" (Double quote)
/ \ (Forward / Back slash)
: (Colon)
? (Question mark)
* (Asterisk)
&lt; &gt; (Smaller / Bigger than)
| (Pipe)
and any character created when pressing the CTRL key</pre>
<p>This error message can also occur if the folder/file name is empty.</p>
