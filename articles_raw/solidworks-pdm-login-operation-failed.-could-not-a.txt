SOLIDWORKS PDM Login issues can often be the result of communication issues between the server and the client. A ping test as outlined in my article:
Testing Connectivity to Archive Server Using the Ping test
, can be used to check for communication issues.
Some login issues can be a result of the logged in user account not having full control of the client registry, specifically this key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Client\SuperSocketNetLib\LastConnect.
Granting the logged in user full control over this key, or one of its parents, should resolve this issue.
