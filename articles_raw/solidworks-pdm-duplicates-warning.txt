In
SOLIDWORKS PDM
, the information a user receives when trying to add a duplicate file has been enhanced. When an attempt is made to add a file with a duplicate file name, a dialog box is displayed that identifies the file name, the location of the existing file, and the local file that is being added.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Duplicate File dialog
Clicking on the warning will generate a list of SOLIDWORKS PDM Duplicates, which are divided into two columns. The right column will display the files that are being added and the left column will show the existing files.
Duplicate file name list
Clicking on a file from either column will open a vault view in a separate window so that the file can be renamed.
