<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM makes it easy to direct colleagues to the exact file you need them to review. The Copy Link command creates a hyperlink to the file inside the vault so recipients can open it directly from email, reports, or task lists.</p>

<p>Right-click a file in the vault view and select <strong>Copy Link</strong>. PDM places the hyperlink on your clipboard, ready to paste into Outlook, Teams, or any document.</p>

<h2>Access Requirements for Recipients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Recipients must have a local vault view on their workstation. Provide setup instructions if they have not connected to the vault yet.</li>
  <li>They need permission to read file contents in the folder and workflow state that hosts the document.</li>
</ul>

<p>When these prerequisites are met, clicking the link launches the recipient&rsquo;s vault view and highlights the file, saving time otherwise spent navigating through folders.</p>
