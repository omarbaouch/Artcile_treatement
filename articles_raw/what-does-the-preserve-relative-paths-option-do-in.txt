If you’ve had a chance to take one of our
Using SOLIDWORKS PDM classes
, it’s likely you’ve heard me rave about the
Copy
or
Move Tree Tool
.  In a recent class, I was asked to clarify what the SOLIDWORKS PDM Move Tree
Preserve relative paths
checkbox does…
Copy/Move Tree – Options – Preserver Relative Paths
What does
“Preserve Relative Paths”
do?
This option allows users to copy/move files and bring their sub-folder structure with them.  The image below gives an example where a top-level assembly has its references split into corresponding folders by file-type;
Sub folder Structure
Now I’m going to run a Move Tree on the top level assembly, with the
“
Preserve Relative Paths”
option
cleared
, and move it to
New Folder;
Preserve relative paths – Cleared
The result is the sub-folder structure is not copied, and all files that were moved are put into the same folder.
Option Cleared – Result
Now, let’s try that again with the
option
checked
, and move it to
New Folder;
Preserve relative paths – Checked
The result is the sub-folder structure is copied, and all the files remain in their file type folder structure within the new location;
Checked – Result
