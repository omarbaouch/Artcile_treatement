<p>This is a continuation of our <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/tag/solidworks-pdm-branching/">SOLIDWORKS PDM Branching and Merging series</a>. In this article, we will look at the steps to Branch SOLIDWORKS files. Branching creates copies of a source file, which can be modified in order to test new concepts.</p>
<p>Branching is available from the Tools pull-down, of the Local Vault View.</p>

<p>The Branch dialog box is similar to the <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2014/07/solidworks-pdm-copy-tree/">Copy Tree</a> dialog and has many of the same options. Like Copy Tree, files must first be Checked-in.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_31101" style="width: 790px"><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Branch-Dialogue.png"><img alt="Branch SOLIDWORKS files" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31101" height="628" src="/assets/images/Branch-Dialogue-780x628.png" title="" width="780"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-31101"><noscript><img alt="Branch SOLIDWORKS files" height="628" src="/assets/images/Branch-Dialogue-780x628.png" title="" width="780"/></noscript></p></a> Branch Dialog Box</div>
<p>There is no option to create a Compressed Archive though, and a Branch Name is required. A Branch Name can only be used once, so development of a Branch naming scheme, early on, can prevent problems coming up with Branch Names, on a per use basis.</p>
<p>Once the Branching operation is complete, the History of the file, will so the Branch operation.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_31102" style="width: 421px"><img alt="Branch Operation in History of a File" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31102" height="170" src="/assets/images/Branch-history.png" title="" width="411"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-31102"><noscript><img alt="Branch Operation in History of a File" height="170" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" src="/assets/images/Branch-history.png" title="" width="411"/></noscript> Branch Operation in History of a File</p></div>
<p>A list of Associated Branches, is available by right clicking on a Branch or the Source file.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_31131" style="width: 446px"><img alt="Selecting Associated Branches" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31131" height="385" src="/assets/images/Associated-Branches.png" title="" width="436"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-31131"><noscript><img alt="Selecting Associated Branches" height="385" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" src="/assets/images/Associated-Branches.png" title="" width="436"/></noscript> Selecting Associated Branches</p></div>
<p>Selecting a Branch, from the Associated Branches fly-out, will display a report, that lists the Source file and any Branches.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_31130" style="width: 803px"><img alt="Associated Branches" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31130" height="439" src="/assets/images/Display-Associated-Branches.png" title="" width="793"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-31130"><noscript><img alt="Associated Branches" height="439" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" src="/assets/images/Display-Associated-Branches.png" title="" width="793"/></noscript> Associated Branches</p></div>
<p>There are options, to open to open the report as a .csv file (in a spreadsheet solution such as Excel), or to save the report as an external file.</p>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>While the Branch operation, can be seen in the History of a file, the file cannot be Rolled Back, to a point before the Branch</li>
<li>A Source file can be Branched multiple times and Branched files can themselves be Branched</li>
<li>The Source file and Branched files, can modified without affecting other Branches. Modifying a Branch will not affect the Source file</li>
<li>While the images in this article, so SOLIDWORKS files, other file types can be Branched.</li>
</ul>
