The SOLIDWORKS PDM Archive Server Settings backup should be completed as part of your regular
Backup Process
, but it’s also a good practice to be run ahead of any major procedures such as an migration or upgrade.  It’s straight forward to configure and can be scheduled to complete automatically.
Important! The archive server settings backup utility does not include the archives or databases, these need to be created and completed separately
How to set up the archive server settings backup
On the archive server; start the
Archive Server Configuration
Tool from
Start
>
Programs
>
SOLIDWORKS PDM

Archive Server dialog
Here you can;
Select which vaults to back up.
Or include all vaults (preferred).
Define a
Backup Location
for the generated backup file (Backup.dat.) to be created.
The recommended location is within the default root to the vault archives, so it’s included within the vault archives backup.
Enable the
Schedule option,
to complete automatically.
Define a
Password
to be required when restoring the backup.
Backup Settings
We can manually launch a backup file to be created using the
Launch Backup
button, otherwise, it will be created as per the defined schedule.
Archive server settings include anything entered at the Archive Server Configuration Tool Level, like the physical location of the archives, defined login types (database or Windows login etc) and passwords.
