The SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integral component for administrating SOLIDWORKS PDM, as it allows us to maintain and capture backups of the database.  When installing a new instance of SQL Express via the installation manager for SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019 and later versions, a separate download and install is required to include SSMS.
