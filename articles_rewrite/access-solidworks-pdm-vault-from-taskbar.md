<p>Need fast access to your SOLIDWORKS PDM Local Vault View without cluttering the desktop? Windows 10 supports jump lists that link directly to recent locationsâ€”including your vault. You can reach engineering data in two clicks without pinning extra shortcuts.</p>

<h2>Use the File Explorer Jump List</h2>

<p>From the Windows taskbar, right-click the File Explorer icon. The jump list displays pinned folders and recent locations managed through SOLIDWORKS PDM.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>File Explorer</strong> on the taskbar.</li>
  <li>Choose your <strong>Local Vault View</strong> from the jump list to launch the vault.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why It Works</h2>

<p>Windows remembers vault views like any other folder, so you can reach data management tools without opening a separate shortcut. The approach streamlines navigation, especially for engineers juggling multiple SOLIDWORKS PDM vaults or project folders.</p>
