<p>Have you ever questioned, how they send a notification to an email that will allow you click on it and take you directly to the file to review? Good news the option is available. You can now add a link to a report, Email, or office document, and Solidworks has made it as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>This great feature in SOLIDWORKS PDM is the ability to generate a hyperlink to any file in the vault through the Right-Click Menu.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_30678" style="width: 790px"><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Copy-Link-1.png"><img alt="SOLIDWORKS PDM 2018 Copy Link" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30678" height="488" src="/assets/images/Copy-Link-1-780x488.png" title="" width="780"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-30678"><noscript><img alt="SOLIDWORKS PDM 2018 Copy Link" height="488" src="/assets/images/Copy-Link-1-780x488.png" title="" width="780"/></noscript></p></a> SOLIDWORKS PDM 2018 Copy Link</div>
<p>Simply right-click on any file, and go to the Copy Link command.</p>
<p>This will copy a hyperlink to the file’s location to your clipboard.</p>
<p>This link can then be pasted into any document, such as a spreadsheet, or can be sent to another user by email.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Paste in email message" height="558" src="/assets/images/Paste-Link-780x558.png" title="" width="780"/><noscript><img alt="Paste in email message" height="558" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" src="/assets/images/Paste-Link-780x558.png" title="" width="780"/></noscript><span data-darkreader-inline-color="" style="color: #ff751a; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif; font-size: 18px; text-align: center; --darkreader-inline-color: #ff802c;">Paste in email message</span></p>
