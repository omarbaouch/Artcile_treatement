So, you have decided to migrate your legacy CAD files into
SOLIDWORKS PDM
with the help of a 3rd party company or your Value-Added Reseller (VAR). Now what?
How do you prepare for a SOLIDWORKS PDM migration and provide what they need to make the process successful?
Watch the video below as TriMech System Architect – Data Management, Keith Thompson discusses what is important to do in advance when working with a 3rd party helping to migrate your data. Moving CAD files from one storage location to another may seem like a simple task, and it can be if you have a small number of files to move.
In this case, it may be as easy as copy and paste, or Pack and Go in the case of SOLIDWORKS CAD files and may only take a few minutes or a couple of hours to complete. However,
moving thousands of documents can be challenging
. This will take a much longer period, most likely weeks. How will you work with a 3rd party to get this done in a timely manner to
minimize the impact to production and maintain the integrity of your data
?
