SOLIDWORKS PDM variables can be mapped to both predefined properties, like Title and Author, as well as to custom-named properties within
SOLIDWORKS
files. In this guide, we’ll discuss how to map variables between SOLIDWORKS and SOLIDWORKS PDM.
How To Map Custom Properties in SOLIDWORKS PDM
Before beginning, you’ll want to identify which SOLIDWORKS Custom Properties you want to map with SOLIDWORKS PDM. These are typically defined in the SOLIDWORKS templates and can been seen by opening the file properties and viewing the Custom tab. In this example, we will map for a “Drawing Title” property.
Launch the SOLIDWORKS PDM Administration either from the PDM Vault or the Windows program search.
In the SOLIDWORKS PDM Administration tool, right-click on
Variables
and choose
New Variable
.
Creating a new variable in SOLIDWORKS PDM
In the Edit Variable dialog box, create a variable called “Drawing Title”.
Click on New Attribute.
In the Selected attribute section:
a. For
Block name
, choose “CustomProperty”.
b. For
Attribute name
, enter “DRAWING_TITLE”.
c. Enter the SOLIDWORKS file extensions that include the property, separating them with commas (e.g., slddrw).
Click
OK
.
In the Card Editor, open the data card for the SOLIDWORKS Drawing file.
Insert an edit box and link it to the newly created Drawing Title variable.

How To Associate the Variable with a PDM Data Card Control
In the SOLIDWORKS PDM Card Editor, open the desired data card.
Place a new control on the card.
In the properties pane of the control, select the
Variable
you created.
Configure any additional properties for the control.
Save the card and exit the Card Editor.
When a variable’s value is altered on the file data card, the associated property value within the file is automatically updated, eliminating the need for users to open and resave the file.
