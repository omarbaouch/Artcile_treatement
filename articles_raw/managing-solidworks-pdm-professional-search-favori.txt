In
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
, users can set up custom Search Favorites to dramatically speed up the process of finding relevant files.  This is great functionality that can be a huge time saver, however, sometimes things can get a little out of hand and Search Favorites can become too much of a good thing.

Editing and Deleting SOLIDWORKS PDM Search Favorites
While creating Search Favorites is a pretty easy process, deleting, or editing the existing Search Favorites isn’t quite as clear.  In fact this cannot be done through the integrated Search within the vault view.
Search Favorites can only be managed through the standalone PDM Search Tool
.
To launch the Search Tool,
click the drop arrow beside the Search icon
on the PDM toolbar in the vault view and select the “
Search Tool …
”
Access the Search Tool
In the standalone PDM Search Tool, it’s possible to
right-click on each Search Favorite
in the list and either edit
Properties
, or
Delete
the Search Favorite entirely.
