It’s no secret I’m a big fan of the
SOLIDWORKS PDM
Copy Tree
Feature.  It have many benefits, especially when
compared to Pack and Go
.   WinZip is the default archive utility for Copy Tree but we have the ability to configure that to
7-zip
via the following steps.
This is a client based setting and won’t change it for all vault users.
Step 1:
Administration Tool
>
Local Settings
>
Settings
Set 7-zip as the File Archiver For Copy Tree
Step 2: Select the Zip Program tab and input the Full path to the 7z.exe.
Enter path for 7-Zip
Step 3: For Arguments to the Zip program, enter a -tzip “%1″ @”%2” and check the Store source file names in a temporary text file box
Enter Arguments
Step 4: Hit OK.  Now 7Zip should be used whenever selecting Compressed Archive as the  Copy Type within Copy Tree
