In
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2020
the performance of the SOLIDWORKS PDM Add-in has improved significantly. Enhancements include the following:
The
SOLIDWORKS PDM task pane tree refreshes faster
and the commands in the SOLIDWORKS PDM toolbar are correctly enabled in the task pane instantaneously when you select a file.
The
data in the task pane tree loads in the background
when you select a file in the task pane tree. The calls to the database are eliminated.
In the Feature Manager design tree or in the graphics area, when you right-click a file and select SOLIDWORKS PDM, the menus are correctly enabled.
When you select a file in the graphics area or in the Feature Manager design tree, the file listed in the task pane tree is selected and all the available commands are enabled.
The
improved communication between client and the PDM Server
delivers a faster experience over all in the CAD add-in similar to the File Explorer.
