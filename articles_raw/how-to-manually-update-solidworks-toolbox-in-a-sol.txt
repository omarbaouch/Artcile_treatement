Before you manually update
SOLIDWORKS Toolbox
in
SOLIDWORKS PDM
Vault, first ensure there is a full recent back up of the file vault database and archive.
Next make sure that all the Toolbox parts are not checked out or in use by any currently checked out assemblies. When an existing major version Toolbox is upgraded, Toolbox parts may be need to be moved, any checked out checked out files will not be moved and could result in the update failing.
To Check whether any SOLIDWORKS Toolbox parts are currently checked out:
Log into a local vault view as “Admin” and use the search tool to make sure no files are checked out under the Toolbox folder in the vault.
To find if any Toolbox parts are used by checked out assemblies, run the SolidWorks Enterprise PDM report “ListAllCheckedOutParentsWithToolboxParts.crp. This report can be downloaded from the SolidWorks Knowledgebase article S-058099. Knowledgebase articles are accessible from the SolidWorks Customer Portal (www.solidworks.com)
