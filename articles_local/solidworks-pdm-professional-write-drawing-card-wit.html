<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional is capable of copying values from a part or assembly card and writing them to a Drawing card. Â The setup to do this is actually quite easy.</p>
<p>To set up this link do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the drawing card in the card editor</li>
<li>Select the control with the variable you want to modify and click variables</li>
<li>Add a new block attribute block named $PRPSHEET (all uppercase)</li>
<li>Set the attribute name to be the same as the block attribute for the part/assembly custom property (number)</li>
<li>Set the extensions to slddrw</li>
</ol>
<p>To test this link:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a part with the custom property added (123456789 in this example)</li>
<li>Create a new drawing and save it (it should have the same property)</li>
<li>Change the property in the part and check it in</li>
<li>Return to the drawing and the card will be updated</li>
</ol>
