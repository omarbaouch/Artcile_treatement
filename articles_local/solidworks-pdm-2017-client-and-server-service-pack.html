<p><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/solidworks-pdm-2017/" target="_blank">SOLIDWORKS PDM 2017</a> Client Server Compatibility now <strong>allows a mismatch</strong> between client and server components within the same major version. Which means any PDM server component upgrades will NOT require an upgrade to each client.</p>

<h2>Attention all IT System Administrators!</h2>
<p>Previously client and server components were required to be same major version and service pack.  This made upgrading a time consuming process.  In SOLIDWORKS PDM 2017, System Administrators are free to upgrade the server components and clients in batches without any users losing access to the vault.</p>
<p>For example, previously <strong>SOLIDWORKS PDM Server components were upgraded</strong> to say 2016 Service Pack 5; <strong>THEN each client required an upgrade to the same version and service pack</strong>.</p>
<p>With SOLIDWORKS PDM 2017, when Server components are upgraded to 2017 Service Pack 3 for example,  the client can be 2017 Service Pack 1,2,3,4 or 5 and still able to access the vault.</p>
