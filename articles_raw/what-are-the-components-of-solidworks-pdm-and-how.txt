SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
is made up of different components including a Server, Archive Server and Clients. Watch the
overview video
below to understand what the components are and how they work together:
With
SOLIDWORKS PDM
, engineers and designers no longer accidentally (or purposefully) step on each others toes while working on a file. With defined workflows, the right person at the right time has access to the file. He or she can then take ownership by checking it out of the vault to ensure they are the only designer making changes to the file. Then, with a simple check in, the file can be put back in the vault with any design changes noted in the file history.
How does SOLIDWORKS PDM work?
To any user, it will look and feel the same because the view into the secure vault is through Windows Explorer or built right in to SOLIDWORKS in the task pane. The complexities behind the scene are completely transparent, making PDM a very easy tool to learn.
The behind the scenes of SOLIDWORKS PDM is nothing more than a SQL database with workflows set up to define how the data moves through the organization. But, it can be set up to do much more than thatâ€”with the possibility of tying in to other management systems and even duplication and replication processes for multiple sites around the world.
