During our
Administering SOLIDWORKS PDM Training course
, I always recommend setting the explorer view as
Details
as there’s a lot more information available for files with this view option.  Directly after I often get asked: “How do I set the SOLIDWORKS PDM Details View as the default in Windows Explorer?”.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Details View
With SOLIDWORKS PDM being integrated within Windows Explorer, its a Windows Folder setting that we have to change
Set Details View as Default
For this example, I am using Windows 10
Navigate to the root level of your vault
Navigate to the root level of your vault
Then select the

To push this setting to all other folders within the vault;
Via Explorer Select;
Tools > Folder Options
Via Explorer Select; Tools > Folder Options
Select the view tab

Now all your sub-folders within the vault will use the details view by default;
