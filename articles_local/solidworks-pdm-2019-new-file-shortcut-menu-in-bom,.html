<p>In previous releases of SOLIDWORKS PDM, when right clicking on any referenced file on the Bill of Materials, Contains or Where Used Tabs wouldn’t give access to the full File Shortcut menu.</p>
<p>Instead, users had to go through two steps, first going directly to that file using the “Browse to” or “Browse to in a New Window”  command, then right clicking on the file in the Vault View window to access the File Shortcut Menu to perform actions such as checking out the file or performing a transition.</p>
<p>Now in SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019, users have access to the full File Shortcut Menu directly in these tabs.</p>

<p>This will provide a significant time savings for users when trying to access any of these commonly used commands from within these tabs.</p>
