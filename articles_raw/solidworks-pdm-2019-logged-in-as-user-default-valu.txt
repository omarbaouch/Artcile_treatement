SOLIDWORKS PDM User Default Value is new in SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019, whereby we can automatically define the logged in user as the
default value
within a Search Card.
How to define the logged in user as the default value for the search card variable
Checked Out by User
Administration Tool > Cards > Search Cards > [Card Name]
For this example, we’re going to use the

Card Properties > Default Values

Within the Default Values dialog;
Select the variable ‘Checked Out by User’
Set the value to; %User%

This option is available for other search card variables, such as;
Label – by User
,
Version Created by User
,
Workflow- Transitions by User
and

How does this help improve our vault?
SOLIDWORKS PDM Search
is a powerful tool.  Incorporating this new SOLIDWORKS PDM User Default Value functionality removes the amount of input required for users, making the search tool easier to use and ultimately saves time by increasing users efficiency and promotes using the search tool more.
Previously, this option was only available via search favorites which is a feature exclusive to PDM Professional.  With this enhancement, PDM Standard users can incorporate the automatic definition into the vault.
