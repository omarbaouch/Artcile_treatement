In SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2016 it’s possible to link PDF document properties with SOLIDWORKS PDM variables and create a two way relationship.

How To Map Custom Properties to PDF Data Cards
First step is to create some variables for this information via
Administration Tool
>
Variables
>
Right-Click
>
New Variable
New Variable from shortcut menu
This example I’ve named PDF_Author
PDF_Author
Next we need to link it to PDF Files. Click
New Attribute
> Enter the data as shown:
Block Name =
CustomProperty
Attribute name =
Author
File Extension =
pdf
Edit Variable
Create the remaining variables as per the following mappings;
Block Name
Attribute Name
CustomProperty
Description
CustomProperty
Keywords
CustomProperty
Subject
CustomProperty
Title
Next we need to link this information in the .PDF file data card.  Create the applicable text and edit boxes, then link them to the variables.
Card Editor > PDF Card
Now the two way relationship is created and when a PDF is added to the vault the custom properties in the PDF will be updated on the data card and when a user updates variable values on the data card, the values are updated in the PDF document properties.
