<p>While I was creating a new SOLIDWORKS PDM vault for another article I was writing, I was about to race through the Configure Vault window, like I normally do. When the oft forgotten &#8216;Use a configuration based on an administrative image export file&#8217; option caught my eye:</p>

<p>I so rarely use this option that I could almost question its worth. Well this option does have some merit and to understand what it does, we need to look at PDM Administration.</p>
<p>Any node of the Vault settings or all of the Vault settings can be exported from the right-mouse shortcut menu and then imported into another vault.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say we want to create a Sandbox (test) Vault, which is always a good idea. Now when you create a new vault, it can be based on the exported SOLIDWORKS PDM Administrative Image Vault settings mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>You may be saying to yourself, &#8220;so what, I can drag and drop nodes between vaults&#8221;. While that is true, and drag and drop may be faster, exporting a vault&#8217;s settings allows you to save snapshots of your vault, that can then be tested under various conditions. At any time, you can reload these snapshots/vault setting exports, to perform additional tests. You can even export individual nodes and test different combinations of those nodes.</p>
