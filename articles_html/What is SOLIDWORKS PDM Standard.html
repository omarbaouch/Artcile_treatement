<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard is the new document management tool that is being released with SOLIDWORKS 2016, it works in a similar manner to SOLIDWORKS Enterprise PDM, which has been renamed to SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional for the 2016 release.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard replaces SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDM, which is set to be discontinued in the 2018 release. </strong>SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard is included with SOLIDWORKS 2016 Professional and Premium licenses.</p></blockquote>
<p>PDM Standard is the ideal data management application for single-site SOLIDWORKS businesses that need an easy-to-use solution that can be easily upgraded to SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional when their needs change. PDM Standard includes many of the high-powered features of SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional, such as <strong>electronic workflow</strong>, <strong>built-in notification system</strong>, and <strong>Windows Explorer integrated search</strong>.</p>
<h3>PDM Standard Client types</h3>
<p>There are three client types available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CAD Editor</strong>, allows interaction from within SOLIDWORKS. This includes viewing, adding and modifying files.</li>
<li><strong>Contributor</strong>, allows interaction through a Windows Explorer window. This includes viewing, adding and modifying files.</li>
<li><strong>Viewer</strong> is similar to the Contributor, but only viewing is allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional licenses of the Contributor and Viewer, can be purchased in 5-packs.</p>
<h3>SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard licenses</h3>
<p>Licenses will be handled by a <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/tag/solidnetwork-license-manager/">SolidNetWork License (SNL) Manager</a>. This is the same utility that SOLIDWORKS network licenses use. A CAD Editor license will be available for each seat of SOLIDWORKS 2016 Professional and Premium license owned. A serial number will be assigned to each eligible SOLIDWORKS 2016 license. The serial numbers can be accessed from the SOLIDWORKS Customer Portal, and if you can&#8217;t find them your SOLIDWORKS Reseller can help you.</p>
<p><strong>The PDM Standard serial numbers are set to be released in early November.</strong></p>
