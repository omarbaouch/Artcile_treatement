Whether it is for maintenance, troubleshooting, or preventing unauthorized access, occasionally there is the need to block SOLIDWORKS PDM login.
To block users
access the SOLIDWORKS PDM Administration tool
and
right-click on a Vault
and select
Properties
.
Vault Properties
Next click on
Block Log-ins
.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Block log-ins
Anyone attempting to log into the vault will receive a the message: “system is locked due to maintenance”
System Maintenance Message
To allow access to the vault, select
Permit Log-ins
and users will once again be able to access the vault.
Permit log-ins
NOTE
: this will not log out users who are already logged in. People who are already logged in, will continue to be able to access the vault.  There is no built-in functionality to force log-outs, but the connection form a client to SQL can be killed. The process to do this, is outlined in another one of my articles, titled “
Killing SQL connection to force a Client logout
