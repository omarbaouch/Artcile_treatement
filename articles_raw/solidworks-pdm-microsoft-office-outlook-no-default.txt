Are you receiving a Microsoft Office Outlook / SOLIDWORKS PDM No Default Mail Client Error while previewing files in the vault?
SOLIDWORKS PDM No Default Mail Client Error
Why am I receiving this SOLIDWORKS PDM No Default Mail Client Error?
SOLIDWORKS PDM uses eDrawings to preview files, and within eDrawings, there’s functionality that sends performance emails.  Essentially; eDrawings is trying to access Outlook to send an email, and has run into some corruption in the registry related to Outlook.
This issue is detailed within the Microsoft Knowledge base
.
As a workaround, we can disable the eDrawings setting to automatically send performance emails.
Fix the error by disabling eDrawings Performance email
Start > Programs > SOLIDWORKS 20xx > eDrawings 20xx
Start > Programs > SOLIDWORKS 20xx > eDrawings 20xx
eDrawings > Tools > Options
General > Clear ‘Enable performance email’
General > Clear ‘Enable performance email’
Ok > Close eDrawings
