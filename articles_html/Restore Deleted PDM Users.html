<p style="text-align: left;">If you have ever needed to restore deleted PDM users that have been prematurely deleted in previous versions of PDM you were pretty much out of luck and all you could do was to create a new user with an identical name. This recreated user wasn’t exactly the same as the deleted user, it has some limitations. In SOLIDWORKS PDM 2023, there is a new feature that will allow you to restore the deleted user permissions and all. Alternatively, if you want to delete the user permanently, please view <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2019/05/how-to-permanently-delete-solidworks-pdm-user/">this article</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>For all who need a quick reminder on how to delete users please see the following steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;">In the Administration tool</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Double-click the Vault where the user exists and log in with Admin credentials.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Expand “Users and Groups Management” and then expand the “Users” node.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Right-click the User in question and then select “Delete”.</li>

<h2>How to restore deleted PDM users in PDM 2022 and previous version years</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In PDM 2022 and previous version years if you wanted to “restore” this user you essentially had to recreate an identical user, but it wasn’t the same exact user and any references to this deleted user in that vault previously had this “Deleted” suffix, you couldn’t check-in files that were accidentally left checked out when the user was originally deleted and you had to reset all of their permissions/groups.</p>
