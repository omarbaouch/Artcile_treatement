<p>When adding files to the vault, there can sometimes be warning that a file with the same name already exists in the vault.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_14631" style="width: 496px"><img alt="duplicate file warning" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14631" height="222" src="/assets/images/duplicate-file-warning.png" title="" width="486"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-14631"><noscript><img alt="duplicate file warning" height="222" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" src="/assets/images/duplicate-file-warning.png" title="" width="486"/></noscript> Duplicate file warning</p></div>
<p>A search of the vault does not reveal any other files with the same name. How could this be?</p>
<p>When a file is saved, or copied to the local vault view, that file is in a private state until the file is checked in. Unless a user has been given the folder permission <em>‘May see files before initial check in (Private State)’</em>, the file is hidden from the user.</p>
<p><img alt="May see local" height="42" src="/assets/images/May-see-local.png" title="" width="269"/><noscript><img alt="May see local" height="42" src="/assets/images/May-see-local.png" title="" width="269"/></noscript></p>
<p>If another user has a file that is in a Private State with the same name that the current user is trying to add to vault, the action will be blocked.</p>
<p>For SOLIDWORKS files, this situation can be avoided by having <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2013/06/epdm-activating-automatically-renaming-of-files-with-serial-number/" target="_blank">EPDM automatically name files saved to the vault</a></p>
