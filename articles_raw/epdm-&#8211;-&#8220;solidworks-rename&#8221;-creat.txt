The SolidWorks rename option available from the SolidWorks Explorer
or Windows Explorer
will not handle renaming the vault file correctly as it only processes the locally cached copy of the file.  It will not rename the vaulted file but create a brand new file.
EPDM has built in support to rename files. To rename a file in an EPDM vault, right-click the file and select the standard Windows rename menu option.
Provided the user has permission in vault to rename the file, it will rename the file and also handle all versions of the file.
