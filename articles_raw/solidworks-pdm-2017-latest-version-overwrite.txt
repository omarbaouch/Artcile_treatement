New in
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2017
is the SOLIDWORKS PDM Latest Version Overwrite
feature which enables users to overwrite a file while retaining the current version value.
Previously in SOLIDWORKS PDM a new version was created for every check in of a file.  Repairing something as simple as a typo would create unnecessary versions using up disk space in the archive server.
NOTE: This function should be used with caution as it permanently deletes file versions.
Permission should be limited to the appropriate personnel.
This feature will require the
‘Can overwrite latest version during check in’
folder and state permissions.
Can overwrite latest version during check in option
Latest overwrite option in workflow
As an example here is a file in my vault which has a spelling mistake;
note the file version is 6/6.
File with spelling mistake in description
To repair this using
Latest Version Overwrite
I’ll first need to check out the file and correct the issue.
Spelling mistake corrected
Then during check-in I will check the
Overwrite Latest Version
box, then select check in.
Check Overwrite Latest Version
The spelling error is corrected and the file version remains at 6/6.
