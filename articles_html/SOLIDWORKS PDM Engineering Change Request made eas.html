<p>Over the years, many customers have asked us to help them manage their engineering changes requests (ECR) and automate their workflows.</p>
<p>This means a lot of different things depending on who you talk with. But typically, It is a very linear process that affects many different departments. And a lot of steps can be forgotten.</p>

<p>It is extremely hard to manage the history of a file and documenting and approving these changes is usually the main areas of concern for companies.</p>
<p>Luckily, managing the history of a file is the bread and butter of what SOLIDWORKS PDM does. Properly documenting why changes were made with appropriate sign off tends to be slightly more challenging.</p>
<p>To assist with this, Javelin has taken common requirements from numerous companies and has done the administration work to implement a great <strong>Engineering Change Request (ECR) module that is fully integrated into SOLIDWORKS PDM system</strong>.</p>
<p>Please watch the video to see what this process looks like:</p>
