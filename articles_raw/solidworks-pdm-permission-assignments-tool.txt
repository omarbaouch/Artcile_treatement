If you’ve had the honor of being named the local vault administrator then it’s extremely likely that someone has approached you regarding their SOLIDWORKS PDM Permission Assignments:
“I need to be able to
<Fill in the blank>
, but I can’t.
<Random Name>
can, but I’m not allowed.  Why is life so unfair?”
Previously as a vault administrator, it was a constant subject at my desk.  I would often be looking in the vault permissions, checking who had permission to do what and whether I needed to add a group to a folder permission of a new folder.  Within the Administration Tool, there’s a SOLIDWORKS PDM Permission Assignments tool that will allow you to quickly look at a vault folder, and see which groups have permissions assigned to it.
Permission Assignments
Administration Tool > [Vault Name] > Groups
Right-Click > Permission Assignments
Group Permission Assignments
Select the folder you’re interested in;
Permission Assignments
Folders
– Lists the folders in the vault
Groups with permissions
– Lists the groups or users that have permissions for the selected folder
This allows us to quickly see which groups have permissions assigned to a specific folder, without opening each group properties dialog separately.
Note
: Permission Assignments is also available at the User level via the Administration Tool, but as a general rule (outside of the admin user) we recommend only assigning permissions at the group level
