<p>How about this? Do less work + yet get more accurate and error-free drawings and sign-offs? Sound good? Then this post is for you…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wanted to write a short blog outlining some of the very nifty ways that SolidWorks Enterprise PDM (a.k.a. EPDM) can automate a whole lot of processes that you take for granted, and at the same time decrease your errors, and add standardization to your sign-offs.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Here I’m just going to show 3 simple ways that Enterprise PDM automatically helps you with this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Number 1 – Title Blocks (<span style="color: #ff9900;">Engineers</span>)</strong></em></p>
<p>I would say about 95% of companies still have their engineers fill in the title block information manually, engineer name, date, description, etc. – but with EPDM there is absolutely no need at all, as soon as you send off a part/drawing to be approved, your name + date + part description all get automatically put in.</p>
<p>Me, being an engineer, would make a drawing, and send it for approval to my manager, and when I do this EPDM will automatically put my name + date + all the project and customer information in for me (I put NONE of this information in myself, it was all done automatically by EPDM when I send my drawing for approval):</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Number 2 – Sign-off + Revision (<span style="color: #ff9900;">Managers</span>)</strong></em></p>
<p>Next, your manager will come along and review, then approve your drawing, and THEIR name + date will be automatically added to the drawing along with a new Rev:</p>

<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Number 3 – Automatic <span style="color: #ff9900;">PDF / STEP / IGES </span></strong></em></p>
<p>Once a part is approved by your manager, EPDM can automatically create PDF files, STEP/IGES files, or any other type of file you’d need and save them to a special directory (so your vendors can grab the files to quote on, for example):</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>In conclusion</strong></em>: With all this automation that EPDM gives you, not to mention since everything is automatic there’s really no way to screw it up, so no more errors either  – why do anything manually ever again? Now that’s what I call doing less work…</p>
<p> </p>
