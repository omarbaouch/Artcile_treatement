<p>In my <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/?p=31119">previous article</a>, we looked at Creating Branches from a Source file, so that we could test different concepts, on these Branches. In this article, we will look at how to combine these changes into a Source File by Merging Branched files with their source.</p>
<p>As with Branch, Merge is available from the Tools pull-down, in the PDM Local Vault view.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_31104" style="width: 495px"><img alt="Selecting Branch from the Tools Pull-down of the Local Vault View" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31104" height="226" src="/assets/images/Merge-Command.png" title="" width="485"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-31104"><noscript><img alt="Selecting Branch from the Tools Pull-down of the Local Vault View" height="226" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" src="/assets/images/Merge-Command.png" title="" width="485"/></noscript> Selecting Branch from the Tools Pull-down of the Local Vault View</p></div>
<p>The dialog Box for Merge, is similar to that for Branch but the Branch Name is not specified, as it already exits for the Source files and the Branches.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_31157" style="width: 790px"><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Merge-dialogue-box.png"><img alt="Merge Dialog Box" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31157" height="628" src="/assets/images/Merge-dialogue-box-780x628.png" title="" width="780"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-31157"><noscript><img alt="Merge Dialog Box" height="628" src="/assets/images/Merge-dialogue-box-780x628.png" title="" width="780"/></noscript></p></a> Merge Dialog Box</div>
<p>The Source and Branch file will be checked out for this operation, if they’re not already checked. Only one file can be Merged, at a time.</p>
<p>Like the Branch operation, the Merge operation will appear in the History of the file.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_31156" style="width: 422px"><img alt="Merge Operation in History of a File" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31156" height="208" src="/assets/images/merge-history-1.png" title="" width="412"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-31156"><noscript><img alt="Merge Operation in History of a File" height="208" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" src="/assets/images/merge-history-1.png" title="" width="412"/></noscript> Merge Operation in History of a File</p></div>
<p>A list of Associated Branches, is available by right clicking on a Branch or the Source file.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_31131" style="width: 446px"><img alt="Selecting Associated Branches" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31131" height="385" src="/assets/images/Associated-Branches.png" title="" width="436"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-31131"><noscript><img alt="Selecting Associated Branches" height="385" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" src="/assets/images/Associated-Branches.png" title="" width="436"/></noscript> Selecting Associated Branches</p></div>
<p>Selecting a Branch, from the Associated Branches fly-out, will display a report, that lists the Source file and any Branches.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_31130" style="width: 803px"><img alt="Associated Branches" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31130" height="439" src="/assets/images/Display-Associated-Branches.png" title="" width="793"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-31130"><noscript><img alt="Associated Branches" height="439" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" src="/assets/images/Display-Associated-Branches.png" title="" width="793"/></noscript> Associated Branches</p></div>
<p>There are options, to open to open the report as a .csv file (in a spreadsheet solution such as Excel), or to save the report as an external file.</p>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>While the Branch operation, can be seen in the History of a file, the file cannot be Rolled Back, to a point before the Branch</li>
<li>While the images in this article, so SOLIDWORKS files, other file types can be Branched.</li>
</ul>
