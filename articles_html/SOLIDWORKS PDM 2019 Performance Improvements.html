<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Performance is always a concern for administrators.</p>
<p>Even small delays quickly compound when they affect multiple users, multiple times a day for repetitive actions.  On the other hand, when dealing with very large vaults with hundreds of users in particular, saving even a few seconds on processes that are repeated hundreds of times a day can mean a big win for an organization overall.</p>
<p>In SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019, working with large assemblies and especially files with complex reference structures is faster than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>Large, complex lists in the &#8220;Contains&#8221; and &#8220;Where Used&#8221; tabs will display much more quickly than in previous releases</strong>.</p>

<p>Additionally, many <strong>file operations such as moving, dragging and dropping, re-naming and adding files are much faster</strong> in SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even simply browsing through the vault, especially browsing into folders that contain a very large number of files that have already been locally cached (something that could significantly impact SOLIDWORKS PDM Performance previously) is much faster in this latest release.</p></blockquote>
