Are you seeing
SOLIDWORKS PDM
blue folders in your vault view, instead of the standard green colour?
Blue Folders
If so,
this simply means you are working offline and not connected live to the vault server
. This happens when you click the Work Offline button on the vault login screen, or attempt to login when you are disconnected from your network, it will default to offline since you are after all, offline.
Return to Green Folders
The solution is an easy one â€” within
Windows Explorer
> click on your vault view folder > in the
Tools
menu > select
Work On-line
.
Work On-line
Your vault view will now connect to the actual vault and your folders will go back to being green.
