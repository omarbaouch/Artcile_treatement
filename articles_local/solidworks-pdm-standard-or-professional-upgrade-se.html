<h3>The benefits of a SOLIDWORKS PDM Upgrade Service from Javelin</h3>
<p>By using the Javelin SOLIDWORKS PDM Upgrade Service you can be confident in the knowledge that your critical business system will be upgraded by an experienced Certified SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional, which means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shorter downtime</strong>: An upgrade to a major SOLIDWORKS release requires that all PDM clients are also upgraded; which will result in your users not having access to the vault until the upgrade has been completed.  We can provide an implementation plan to minimize your downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade expertise and experience</strong>: We are familiar with the common PDM migration issues.  This knowledge allows us to provide recommendations and/or solutions to resolve your issues.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive certified service</strong>: We will perform a full upgrade following SOLIDWORKS’ procedures, thus ensuring that you will not have an unsupported scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize Performance and Health-check</strong>: As part of the upgrade, we ensure all settings are in place to maximize your database performance.</li>
<li><strong>Peace of mind</strong>: Upgrading SOLIDWORKS PDM can often seem an overwhelming process. Not all components are upgraded using the SOLIDWORKS installation manager. Having an upgrade carried out by certified experts ensures your peace of mind for your critical business system and data.</li>
</ul>
