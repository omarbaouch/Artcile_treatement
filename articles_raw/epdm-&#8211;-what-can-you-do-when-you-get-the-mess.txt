There can be a number of reasons for this message, some of which can be controlled by good Vault View management, others can indicate permissions issues, while other still can indicate problems with file(s).
In many cases this issue can be overcome by:
Copy or save the file that can’t be saved outside the vault.
Do an
Undo Check-out
on the file
(you may need the help of your EPDM administrator for this step)
Check out the file.
Copy the file from Step 1 back into the vault overwriting the one you checked out.
Check-in the file.
This should allow to check in the file without loosing all the work you have done since the last successful check-in.
