<p>When checking in or transitioning a number of files, you may want to route the files to different states. For instance, you may want to route SolidWorks files to one state and supporting documents to a different state.</p>
<p><img alt="workflow" height="358" src="/assets/images/workflow.jpg" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4;" title="" width="587"/><noscript><img alt="workflow" height="358" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" src="/assets/images/workflow.jpg" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4;" title="" width="587"/></noscript></p>

<p>In order to make this work, the transition must be set to Automatic and at least one condition must be added to filter which files are allowed into the target state.</p>
<p><img alt="transaction condition" height="438" src="/assets/images/transaction-condition.jpg" title="" width="659"/><noscript><img alt="transaction condition" height="438" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" src="/assets/images/transaction-condition.jpg" title="" width="659"/></noscript></p>
<p>In the above example, I used a category to only allow CAD files into the target state, but other conditions or combination of conditions could be used.</p>
