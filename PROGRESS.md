# Progress Log

## 2025-09-16
- [x] Rewrote "3 Reasons for Upgrading SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard to Professional" as <code>articles_rewrite/upgrade-solidworks-pdm-standard-professional.md</code> with refreshed front matter, structure, and localized image references.
- [x] Rewrote "3DEXPERIENCE vs SOLIDWORKS PDM Technical Breakdown" as <code>articles_rewrite/3dexperience-vs-solidworks-pdm-comparison.md</code>, preserving image order and updating technical comparisons.
- Images referenced from <code>/assets/images</code> remain unchanged; alt text added or confirmed where missing.
- Front matter dates use 2025-09-16 (current working date) until original publication dates are identified.

### Next Steps for Future Agents
- Continue processing remaining articles in <code>articles_raw/</code>; match each to the corresponding HTML in <code>articles_local/</code> to confirm image placement.
- Maintain the established Markdown structure with front matter, HTML headings, and <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> blocks for images.
- Update this log with newly completed articles and any deviations or discoveries (e.g., missing images or metadata).
