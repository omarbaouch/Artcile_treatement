When troubleshooting SOLIDWORKS PDM issues, or when performing operations like software upgrades you may need to manually backup the SOLIDWORKS PDM Database outside of your normally scheduled Maintenance Plan.
This backup can be run as a task within the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
Step 1:
In the Management Studio, right click on the PDM database that needs to be backed up, then go to the
Tasks
flyout and select “
Back Up…
”
Step 2:
In the
Back Up
dialogue box, on the
General
page, ensure that the
Backup type
is set to
Full
and the
Backup component
is set to
Database
.  In the
Destination
area, make sure that the
Back up to
option is set to
Disk
.  You may need to select the existing destination and select “Remove”, then click “
Add…
“.
Backup the SOLIDWORKS PDM Database
Step 3
:  In the
Select Backup Destination
dialog, click “…” and select the folder where the backup file should be created.  Enter a name for the backup file, including the “bak” extension. Clicking Ok in the
Select Backup Destination
dialogue will return to the
General
screen of the
Back Up
dialogue.
Select Backup Destination
Step 4:
On the
Media Options
page of the Back up dialog window, set the
Overwrite media
option to
Overwrite all existing backup sets
, then check the option under
Reliability
to
Verify backup when finished
.
Overwrite media option
Compress backup
Step 5 (Optional):
The backup file size will depend on the size of the vault.  It can be quite large, possibly several gigabytes.  When compressed however the file size will decrease dramatically.  If the file size will be very large, on the
Backup Options
page of the Back up dialogue window, you may wish to set the Compression action to
Compress backup.
Alternatively, the .bak file can be compressed using Windows compression or a third party program.
