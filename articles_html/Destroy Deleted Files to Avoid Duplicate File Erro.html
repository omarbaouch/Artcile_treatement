<p>You attempt to check in a SOLIDWORKS PDM file, but you receive a message that <em>&#8216;a file with this name already exists in the vault&#8217;</em>. You perform a search and cannot find this file?!</p>
<p>This can happen when a file with the same name has been deleted. Deleting a file in the vault, is similar to deleting a file in Windows Explorer; <strong>the file is moved to a Recycle bin of sorts</strong>. This allows the deleted files to be recovered.</p>
<p>In order to check in the new file, the deleted file must be destroyed. This is done by right clicking on the folder that contained the deleted file and selecting <strong>Properties.Â </strong>From the<em> Deleted Items</em> folder, right-click the deleted file and select <strong>Destroy</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: You will have to have the required administrative permissions to destroy the file.</p></blockquote>
