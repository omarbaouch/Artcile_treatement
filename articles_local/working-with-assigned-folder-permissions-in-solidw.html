<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM 2018 now allows Administrators greater flexibility and control when working with Assigned Folder Permissions.</p>
<p>Previously, each folder had to be assigned permissions one at a time.  Starting with 2018 however, multiple folders can be selected at a time and their permissions set.</p>
<p>To select multiple folders you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold down<em><strong> Ctrl and click</strong> </em>to select multiple individual folders.</li>
<li>Hold down <em><strong>Shift and click</strong></em> to select multiple folders in order together.</li>
<li><em><strong>Left Click and Drag</strong></em> to select multiple folders.</li>
</ul>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_30570" style="width: 749px"><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Selecting-Folders.png"><img alt="Assigned Folder Permissions" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30570" height="867" src="/assets/images/Selecting-Folders.png" title="" width="739"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-30570"><noscript><img alt="Assigned Folder Permissions" height="867" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" src="/assets/images/Selecting-Folders.png" title="" width="739"/></noscript></p></a> Assigned Folder Permissions</div>
<p> </p>
<p>When multiple folders are selected, the Permissions checkboxes may display one of three different ways:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Assignments.png"><img alt="" height="98" src="/assets/images/Assignments.png" title="" width="319"/><noscript><img alt="" height="98" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" src="/assets/images/Assignments.png" title="" width="319"/></noscript></a></p>
<p>An empty check box:  This indicates that this permission has not been set on any of the selected folders.</p>
<p>A check box filled with a green square:  This indicates that the permission has been set on at least one of the selected folders.</p>
<p>A checked box:  This indicates that the permission has been set on all of the selected folders.</p>
