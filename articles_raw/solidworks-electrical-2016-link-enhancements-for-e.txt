To improve the integration of SOLIDWORKS Electrical 2016 with the rest of the SOLIDWORKS product portfolio there are now more options for linking with
SOLIDWORKS Enterprise PDM
. SOLIDWORKS Electrical users can select which BOM reports they wish to export and also define the target subfolder where the files will be saved.
Users can also enter a parameter to ‘run after report’ in order to open the file containing the exported Bill of Materials with a different application.
