<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Dispatch Action is a very powerful, but often overlooked tool in <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/solidworks-pdm-2017/">SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional</a>, and with PDM 2017, it’s now even more powerful.</p>
<p>In previous releases it was only possible to use the Dispatch action to Copy, Delete, or Rename files in the vault.</p>
<p>In SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2017, the Dispatch action can also be used to <em>move</em> files to a different location in the vault. This Move action will maintain the files history within the vault and will update any files referencing that file with the new folder location.</p>

<h3>Using the SOLIDWORKS PDM Dispatch Action</h3>
<p>The Dispatch Action can be triggered manually by a Menu command, during a state transition, during checkout or during add.  The file being Moved/Renamed does not necessarily have to be the file that triggered the Action.  For instance, a dispatch action could be set up to move a PDF export of an approved drawing to an “Archive” folder when the SOLIDWORKS .slddrw file is transitioned to an “Under Change” state.</p>
