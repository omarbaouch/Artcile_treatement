How often do you find yourself spending valuable time searching for a model or a file? Have you ever had to recreate a model because you could not find the original?
Using SOLIDWORKS EPDM
Have you ever spent time creating a design only to discover later that one of your colleagues had previously modeled a similar design that would have met your needs? If you are not using an integrated product data management (PDM) system, chances are you can relate to these scenarios.

Adapting, leveraging, and reusing existing designs can save you time and save your company money. It can also help you bring new products to market faster, improve your company’s profitability, and win new business.
