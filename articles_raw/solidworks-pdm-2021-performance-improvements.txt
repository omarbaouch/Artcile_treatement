SOLIDWORKS PDM 2021
has improved performance of file-based operations such as Add Files, Check-In, Destroy and other operations related to workflows.
Improved system performance will help you quickly add, check-in, open, and change state of files with large reference structure. The Add Files operation is between 1.5 to 3 times faster in SOLIDWORKS PDM 2021.
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2021 Performance
The Check-in and change state operations have increased performance by approximately 25%. The Check-in dialog box opens quickly in PDM 2021 with large assemblies or parts with a high number of configurations.
NOTE
: The level of performance improvement can vary depending on the number of files, network bandwidth and CPU cores.
Destroy Files
In SOLIDWORKS PDM 2021 you can destroy files or folders quicker than before. This operation has significant improvement in performance when destroying a large number of files.
Other PDM Operations and Workflows
Performance is significantly improved for the following operations:
For folders containing a very large number of files:
Check-in and Check-out of a file
Adding a new file by dragging or by copying and pasting
Creating a new file from a template
For assemblies with a large number of components at a single level, when working in SOLIDWORKS:
Opening files
Saving files
Switching windows
Editing a target file name in the Copy Tree dialog box in a high-latency environment
Using Copy Tree when a user setting is added to clear variable values
