<p>Now that <a href="http://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/downloads.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SOLIDWORKS 2016 SP0 is available</a>, a NEW PDM tool is also available to eligible customers, <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2015/10/solidworks-pdm-standard/" target="_blank">SOLIDWORKS 2016 PDM Standard</a>. We’ve been receiving calls from customers wondering why they cannot yet install and begin using PDM Standard.</p>
<p>SOLIDWORKS has yet to “enable” PDM Standard on customers’ licenses. The “enabling”, or “turning on” if you will, is scheduled to happen sometime <strong>mid-November, 2015</strong>.</p>
<p>Eligible customers will be notified when their PDM Standard license is available. Until then, don’t let the anticipation get to you too badly! 🙂</p>
