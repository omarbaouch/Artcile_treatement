Currently there is no functionality to force a SOLIDWORKS PDM logout, but the connection between the client and SQL can be temporarily killed. You should only kill SOLIDWORKS PDM if a user cannot be logged out normally.
If you need to prevent access to a vault, you can block a login,
refer to my article on how to Block a PDM Login for more information
.
To kill SOLIDWORKS PDM / SQL connection, you need to access the
SQL Management Studio
, then
right-click on the SQL server
, and select
Activity Monitor
.
SQL Activity Monitor
Click on the
Process
tab and look for the process
EdmServer.exe
that is associated with the user you want to disconnect.

Right-click on the process and choose

from the shortcut menu.

If the user now attempts to navigate within the vault they will receive the following message.

Further attempts to access the vault will result in a blank Vault View.

Before the user can access the vault again, they will need to first log out. If
login is currently blocked
, they will then receive the message below, when they try to log in.
