Are you a searcher or an explorer?
If you’re a searcher then you’re in luck as
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
comes equipped with a powerful search tool, that can minimize the time it takes to locate a file or folder.
Let’s start with a look at some of the basic commands located within the search tool:
Search Commands
Using Wildcards
Let’s get a bit more advanced and look at how we can use wildcards to squeeze even more functionality out of this tool.
Wildcard
= a character that will match any character or sequence of characters in a search.
By default the search will look for anything matching the parameters.  For example; if I search
Jav
, it will search for any folder or file name containing ‘Jav’:
Search All
Using the asterisk wildcard, we can search for specific file types containing our search parameter.  For example; *
jav*.sldasm
will look for any SOLIDWORKS Assembly with ‘Jav’
as part of the filename:
Search .SLDASM
Need to look for a specific word document, but unsure whether it’s .doc or .docx filetype?
*Jav*doc*
Search .doc & .docx
