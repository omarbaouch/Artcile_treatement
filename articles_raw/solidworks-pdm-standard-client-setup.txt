Once
SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard
has been installed, the
vault has been created and configured
, it is time to connect users to the vault. In SOLIDWORKS PDM Administration,
right-click on your vault

Connect
. This step can be skipped, if you are already connected.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard Client Setup
If this is the first time accessing your vault, you may be prompted to accept the terms of the SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard License Agreement.
License agreement
Enter the password for the vault, you defined when you created your vault.
Log into Vault
After logging in, again
right-click your vault
, but this time choose
Create Local View
. A local view is required in order for users to access files in the vault.
Local view
Select where the local view of the vault  will be added. To avoid the Windows 256 character limit on path length, I recommend placing the view at the root of a drive.
Local view folder
You can make the local vault view visible for all users, or you can restrict it to the logged in Windows user, when the local view was created.
Access for All Users
On the next screen, You will be prompted to log into your vault.
Log in to your vault
You will then see be presented with a local view of the vault. In Windows 7 some of the vault panels,  may not be visible. Left click and drag the solid white bar near the top of the local vault view, to see all the panels.
