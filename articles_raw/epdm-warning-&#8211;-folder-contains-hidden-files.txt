The warning “folder contains hidden files you may not delete”, may appear when destroying a folder. There are a number of reasons why this may occur.
The user destroying the folder, lacks read permissions to some files in that folder. Typically it would be because the user does not have sufficient permissions, in a workflow state.
A file in the folder has not been checked in yet.
An orphaned file.
How to delete the folder
For the first two possibilities, try logging in as the EPDM Admin and then destroying the folder.
For an orphaned file, try adding a text file to the folder that cannot be deleted. This should trigger a orphan record cleanup process and allow the folder to be deleted.
