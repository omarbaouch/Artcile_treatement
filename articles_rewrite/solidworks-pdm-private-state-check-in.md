<p>Private state files in SOLIDWORKS PDM can easily be mistaken for vault-managed data even though they only exist on a local workstation. Failing to check them in leaves designs vulnerable to loss and limits what you can do with the files. Treat this as a cautionary tale: if a file matters, get it into the archive server right away.</p>

<h2>What Counts as a Private State File?</h2>

<p>Private state files appear when a user copies or saves data into the local vault view but never completes the check-in. Other users might see the filename if they have permission to view private state files, yet the content remains isolated on the creator&rsquo;s machine.</p>

<p>Because the archive server never receives the file, there is no history, no replicated cache, and no backup. A failed hard drive or accidental deletion eliminates the only copy.</p>

<h2>Operational Limits of Private State Files</h2>

<p>Working from home or over a slow VPN often tempts users to delay check-ins, but private state files block core SOLIDWORKS PDM capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot transition private state files through workflows or capture revision history.</li>
  <li>Copy Tree and Move Tree skip referenced components when the source files are still private.</li>
  <li>Deleting a private file bypasses PDM recovery tools and the Windows Recycle Bin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Checking in a handful of files regularly is far faster than pushing an entire project through the vault at the last minute, especially over limited bandwidth connections.</p>

<h2>Lost Work Cannot Be Restored</h2>

<p>If the workstation holding the private state files is damaged, the vault has nothing to recover. File properties show no history, and administrators cannot restore the data from the archive.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Check in files as soon as you create or modify them. Doing so protects your work, enables revision tracking, and keeps SOLIDWORKS PDM&rsquo;s automation effective. Private state files should be the exception, not the rule.</p>
