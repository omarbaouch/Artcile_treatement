One of my favorite new enhancements within
SOLIDWORKS PDM 2017
is that
Vault Administrators can copy group permissions and members from an existing group when creating a new group
.  Previously the only way to copy permissions to a new group was manually; which was a monotonous task to say the least.
To use the SOLIDWORKS PDM Copy Group, first create a new group by selecting
Administration Tool
>
Groups
> [Right-Click]
New Group
;
New Group Command
Give it a
Group Name
Select a
Copy From Group
Select
Copy Permissions
and/or
Copy Members
.
Click
Next
Create New Group
Members copied
And your new group is created, complete with the
Group Members
copied, and the
Group Permissions.
Permissions Copied
