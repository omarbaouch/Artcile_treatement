When SOLIDWORKS CAD software is updated to the latest release, the SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDM Vault must also be updated. The following outlines how this can be done.
If possible, first:
Have all users check in any files they currently have checked out.
Ensure all users log out of the vault.
Lock the SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDM Vault
To prevent users from logging in the vault during the update, the vault can be locked from the
Vault Settings
tab of the VaultAdmin tool.
SOLIDWORKS Workgroup Vault Settings
Open the vault admin tool and ensure that
Validate Vault,
under the
Vault Management
tab is checked. This can ensure the integrity of the vault. The vault can also be rebuilt, in order to increase performance.
Please note, validating and rebuilding the vault can take several hours to complete. During this time the vault cannot be accessed.
Validate Vault controls
From the  the
Vault Management
tab stop the SolidWorks Workgroup PDM service.
Stop Service
Make a backup of the vault.
Update the software
Start the Installation Manager by launching Setup from the installation media media.
After the Installation Manager Starts, select
SOLIDWORKS
Workgroup PDM
from
Server
Products
.
Note: Starting with Workgroup 2012, a validation code must be generated in order to complete the installation
. Please refer to our blog post on Installing SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDM
server:
Installing SOLIDWORKS 2016 Workgroup PDM Server
Restart the SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDM Vault
After the installation has finished, restart the
SOLIDWORKS Workgroup PDM
service, if it does not start on it’s own. When the service starts, the vault will be validated and rebuilt.
Again this,
can take several hours to complete. During this time the vault cannot be accessed.
