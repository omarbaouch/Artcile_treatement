Using Transition Conditions, files can be pushed to a branch of workflow, or into a different workflow.
This simple workflow illustrates how we can filter which destination workflow a file will enter, based on input from a file data card.
Filter Workflow
In this example file data card, the value for the variable Part Type, can be set to Custom or Standard.
Data Card
Automatic transitions are used in this workflow, so that the only input required, is through the data card.
Automatic filter workflow
Conditions are set for each transition, to filter which direction a file will take in the workflow. A file with a value of  ‘Custom’, for the variable Part Type, will transition to the Custom workflow link.  A file with a value of  ‘Standard’, for the variable Part Type, will transition to the Standard workflow link.
Condition part type
The workflow links will then move the files to the appropriate destination workflow.
