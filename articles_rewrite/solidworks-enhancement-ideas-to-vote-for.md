<p>The SOLIDWORKS community submitted nearly one thousand enhancement requests ahead of SOLIDWORKS World 2015. To help you focus your votes, we curated 20 ideas that would make daily modeling, simulation, and SOLIDWORKS PDM data management more efficient. Add your support on <a href="https://my.solidworks.com/">my.solidworks.com</a> so Dassault Systèmes sees the demand.</p>

<h2>How to Participate</h2>

<p>Sign in to the Top Ten List on my.solidworks.com, open each idea below, and click Vote. Many threads include user comments that outline implementation details—reviewing them can strengthen your internal business case for upgrades across SOLIDWORKS CAD and SOLIDWORKS PDM.</p>

<h2>20 Ideas That Boost Productivity</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Display the exact item causing an error</strong> to speed troubleshooting by highlighting the failing geometry directly in the graphics area.</li>
  <li><strong>Select inner loops on a face</strong> so hole selection for Convert Entities or Offset Entities becomes a one-click operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Tap GPU acceleration via CUDA or OpenCL</strong> for compute-intensive graphics and simulation tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Add variable pull-direction draft</strong> to streamline complex surface modeling.</li>
  <li><strong>Support both-direction patterns</strong> so symmetric features require half as many pattern definitions.</li>
  <li><strong>Let patterns reference normals to planes</strong> to avoid building extra construction geometry.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep untrimmed surfaces separate after untrim</strong> to preserve valuable reference geometry.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatically reattach dangling dimensions</strong> with an intelligent suggestion workflow.</li>
  <li><strong>Expose the same dimension options for multi-select</strong> that currently exist for single dimensions.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide an unknit surfaces command</strong> to separate imported faces at specific edges.</li>
  <li><strong>Allow Smart Dimension to pick angle or distance on the fly</strong>, reducing extra clicks during detailing.</li>
  <li><strong>Show motion envelopes</strong> that visualize the swept volume of components throughout their range of motion.</li>
  <li><strong>Auto-create explode route lines</strong> so exploded views communicate intent instantly.</li>
  <li><strong>Default slot faces to Slot mates</strong> to simplify assembly constraints.</li>
  <li><strong>Add a command to create flat configurations</strong> without dropping a flat-pattern view on a drawing first.</li>
  <li><strong>Offer optimized splines with controlled maximum curvature</strong> for smoother industrial design surfaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Link sheet metal gauge values to custom properties</strong> for better reporting inside drawings and SOLIDWORKS PDM.</li>
  <li><strong>Expose feature dimensions in Move/Copy Bodies</strong> so translations can be configured and driven.</li>
  <li><strong>Update certified graphics drivers during upgrades</strong> to keep CAD and data management clients aligned.</li>
  <li><strong>Let users save only SpeedPak configurations</strong> when sharing assemblies externally while protecting IP.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Bonus Request: Pattern Coordinate Systems</h2>

<p>One more idea deserves attention: patterning coordinate systems. Being able to replicate reference systems through linear, circular, sketch-driven, or pattern-driven tools would accelerate mate reference creation by an estimated 90–99%.</p>

<h2>Keep the Momentum Going</h2>

<p>Share these ideas with your engineering and data management teams so everyone votes. SOLIDWORKS listens when the community rallies around clear productivity wins, and your support helps shape both CAD and SOLIDWORKS PDM roadmaps.</p>
