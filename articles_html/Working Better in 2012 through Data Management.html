<p>If you’re like most people, you’ve built a list of Resolutions for the New Year. If you’re anything like me, then you’ve put “Find ways to work smarter &amp; faster” on that list of <em>To Do’s.</em></p>
<p>Enter EPDM.</p>
<p>EPDM is to data management what SolidWorks is to 3D design, because it&#8217;s intended to make your life easier. It is dead simple to use (it looks just like Windows!), it reduces search times to pretty much instantaneous results, eliminates file redundancy and clutter, and allows designers to collaborate more effectively with one another &amp; with others in your organization.</p>

<p>Many of our customers tell us that SolidWorks EPDM is saving them time, reducing costs, and just generally making their work flow more smoothly. A lot of them have seen the benefits of design reuse by employing EPDM, so when I read this white paper (<em>5 Ways PDM Can Help You Succeed Through Design Reuse</em>) over the Holidays, I couldn&#8217;t help but draw the comparison between their success and my <strong>own</strong> desire to work better/faster/smarter this year.  You really should give it a read.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start my year off with a good plan in place to be better in 2012.</p>
<p><em>What about you?</em></p>
