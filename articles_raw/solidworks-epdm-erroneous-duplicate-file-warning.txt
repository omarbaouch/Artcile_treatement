When adding files to the vault, there can sometimes be warning that a file with the same name already exists in the vault.
Duplicate file warning
A search of the vault does not reveal any other files with the same name. How could this be?
When a file is saved, or copied to the local vault view, that file is in a private state until the file is checked in. Unless a user has been given the folder permission
‘May see files before initial check in (Private State)’
, the file is hidden from the user.
If another user has a file that is in a Private State with the same name that the current user is trying to add to vault, the action will be blocked.
For SOLIDWORKS files, this situation can be avoided by having
EPDM automatically name files saved to the vault
