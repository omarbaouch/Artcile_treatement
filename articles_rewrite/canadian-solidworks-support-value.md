<p>A small engineering team cannot afford downtime when delivering custom equipment. CT Logics Inc., based in Edmonton, Alberta, designs bespoke coiled tubing systems for land and offshore projects. With every project tailored to customer requirements, the company relies on SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD and SOLIDWORKS PDM to keep designs accurate and accessible.</p>

<p>When new releases arrive, Javelin&rsquo;s subscription service gives CT Logics direct access to technicians who can remote into the system, walk through upgrade steps, and ensure the vault continues to run smoothly.</p>

<h2>Local Presence and Responsive Service</h2>

<p>With representatives located in Edmonton, Javelin provides in-person sessions and on-site assistance when complex data management issues arise. Fast response times keep CT Logics focused on engineering instead of troubleshooting missing components or configuration questions.</p>

<h2>Adapting to New Industries</h2>

<p>The Alberta energy sector has experienced major shifts, prompting CT Logics to diversify into wind power projects. SOLIDWORKS enables the team to apply existing skills to new product lines without learning a different design platform, and the subscription service ensures technical resources are available during the transition.</p>

<h2>Benefits of SOLIDWORKS Subscription Service</h2>

<p>Beyond helpdesk access, SOLIDWORKS Subscription Service delivers software upgrades, special releases, and webcasts tailored to members. The program keeps CT Logics current with the latest data management features and best practices, contributing to their competitive edge.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>For CT Logics, responsive Canadian SOLIDWORKS support is as important as the software itself. Javelin Technologies provides the local expertise, quick turnaround, and training resources that keep the company&rsquo;s SOLIDWORKS PDM environment optimized for demanding custom engineering projects.</p>
