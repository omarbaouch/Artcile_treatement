A nice new function has been added to the out of the box SOLIDWORKS PDM Convert Task in
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2017
.  When building the file name for the output file, it is now possible to select Data Card Variables right within the interface.
In previous releases of the SOLIDWORKS PDM Convert Task, it was possible to add Variable values to the output file name, but it required extensive manual editing of the task script.
Now in 2017 this function is built right into the default task script.
To take advantage of this new feature:
Update the Task Add In to the latest version.
Then double click the Convert Task (or any custom task created from the Convert Task) and go to the  “Output File Details” page.
Click the > box next to the output path and select the Data Card Variables desired.
