When you rename an assembly file in SOLIDWORKS via the FeatureManager Design Tree SOLIDWORKS PDM will update all the references for you automatically.
Here I have a SOLIDWORKS flashlight assembly:
SOLIDWORKS Flashlight Assembly
I’d like to change the name of my sub assembly
Head_sub
to
JavHeadSubAssy
.
SOLIDWORKS PDM rename file requirements
Before we can change the name there are a few requirements to check off first:
The file must be checked out
PDM add-in installed and loaded
The user has the state and folder permission to Add or rename a file
If you are missing any of the above requirements you will receive an error message.
Note: To see the
Rename
option in SOLIDWORKS from the right click menu, this must first be enabled:
Tools > Options > System Options > FeatureManager > “Allow component files to be renamed from FeatureManager tree“
SOLIDWORKS PDM rename file process
Within the FeatureManager Design Tree
right-click the part/sub-assembly name
you would like to change, and select
rename
from the shortcut menu as shown in the figure below
Rename Assembly
After a rebuild and save, the name will be updated within SOLIDWORKS PDM:
Flashlight Assembly References Updated
It even updates the components within the sub-assembly:
Sub-Assembly Components Updated
Easy!
If you’re looking to
create a new assembly and use your current assembly as a base
, then
this feature isn’t the one for you
