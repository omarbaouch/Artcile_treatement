NOTE
: The Archive log contains a history of occurrences on the server, which can be useful when it comes to troubleshooting. Generally it is
good practice not to empty the archive log
, but if the log contains errors that have been addressed, clearing the log may prevent confusion, when troubleshooting  new issues.
