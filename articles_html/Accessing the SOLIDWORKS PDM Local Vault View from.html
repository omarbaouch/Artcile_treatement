<p>Recently I was asked how to add a SOLIDWORKS PDM Vault View shortcut, to the Windows Taskbar. I was told that in previous Windows releases, this was possible. I did some research and found that this was never possible; in previous releases of Windows, but it was possible in the first preview of Windows 10.</p>
<p>There is a way to access theÂ SOLIDWORKS PDM Local Vault View from the Windows 10 Taskbar, this is done by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-clicking on the Windows Explorer Icon, in the Windows Taskbar</li>
<li>Then clicking on the PDM Local Vault View.</li>
</ol>
