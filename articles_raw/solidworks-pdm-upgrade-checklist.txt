If you are planning on upgrading to the latest release of PDM, then make sure you follow our SOLIDWORKS PDM Upgrade Checklist below:
NOTE
: Upgrading PDM carries some risk. It’s your company’s IP contained in your vault.
Javelin can perform your upgrade
for you to ensure it’s done right with minimal down time and risk of data loss. Contact your Javelin account manager for a quote. If a PDM upgrade is self-served and it goes poorly, our PDM Technical Support can help get the upgrade back on track, and the time may be billable.
