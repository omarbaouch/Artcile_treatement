<p>Replica vaults occasionally stay offline even after the hardware returns to service. If registry values still indicate that a SOLIDWORKS PDM Archive Server is replicated, users can see persistent connection errors. Correcting the registry entry resolves the issue quickly.</p>

<h2>Typical Error Messages</h2>

<p>Administrators generally encounter two warnings: the archive server connection failure and a complementary vault communication error. Both point to the replica still being flagged as active in the Windows registry.</p>

<h2>Update the Replica Registry Value</h2>

<p>On the archive server, open the Registry Editor and browse to:</p>

<pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SolidWorks\Applications\PDMWorks Enterprise\ArchiveServer\Vaults\&lt;vaultname&gt;</pre>

<p>Locate the <code>Replicate</code> string. Delete the value entirely or set it to <code>0</code> to indicate that the replica is no longer present. Restart the SOLIDWORKS PDM Archive Server service to re-establish connections.</p>

<h2>Prevent Future Warnings</h2>

<p>Whenever you decommission or temporarily remove a replica, ensure the registry reflects the change. Keeping archive server replication values accurate prevents unnecessary downtime and maintains a reliable SOLIDWORKS PDM data management environment.</p>
