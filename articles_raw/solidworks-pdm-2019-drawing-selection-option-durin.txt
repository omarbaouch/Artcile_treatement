New in SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019, we have the option:
Do not select references that are defined as drawing nodes during state change
.  Previously we only had the option:
Do not mark referenced files when changing state
and couldn’t specify to only exclude drawings.
Do not select references that are defined as drawing nodes during state change
By default this setting is disabled, to enable it;
Administration Tool > Users/Groups > Username/Group Name
Right Click > Settings
SOLIDWORKS PDM User Settings
Settings > Reference Dialog
Check > Do not select references that are defined as drawing nodes during state change
Do not select references that are defined as drawing nodes during state change
Click OK and save the setting.
How can this SOLIDWORKS PDM Drawing Nodes setting help improve our vault?
We’ve all done it….accidentally transitioned something we didn’t mean to.  Having this setting available helps users to customize the vault further to their preferred setup, resulting in less erroneous transitions thus increasing efficiency.
