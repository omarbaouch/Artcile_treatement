When files are
DESTROYED
(this is different to being deleted and likely only the admin has permission), they aren’t removed from the vault archive until the SOLIDWORKS PDM Cleaner Service has been run.
This can cause issues when your IT admin is frantically trying to clear space when the hard drives are close to being full on the archive server and not seeing results from all the file destruction.  In this situation a better option would be to spread the archive over multiple drives (see
here
), but if this isn’t an option you can change the time the cleaner service runs from the default 3 AM.
