Currently if you need to make changes to User Viewer settings, each user has to be updated individually.
Viewer settings
If there are multiple users to update, this can be a tedious time consuming task. To avoid this toil, the SOLIDWORKS PDM Viewer Settings can be updated for all users by using the followingÂ SQL query:
Update Settings

 set value = (

 select Value From Settings S

 Inner Join Users U on S.UserID = U.UserID

 Where VarID = 16 and Username = 'Admin')

 Where VarID = 16 and UserID != 2
First update the Viewer settings for the Admin and then run the query on your vault.
