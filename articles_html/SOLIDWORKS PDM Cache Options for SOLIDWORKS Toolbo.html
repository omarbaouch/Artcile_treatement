<p>In SOLIDWORKS PDM there are options that can automatically handle how files are cached. These options are available for both the User and Group Properties.</p>
<p>Here is how you can automatically get the latest cache of SOLIDWORKS Toolbox files managed in a SOLIDWORKS PDM vault during log in:</p>
<p>Go to User/Group Properties, click on &#8220;Cache Options&#8221; &gt; Select your SOLIDWORKS Toolbox folder &gt; check the &#8220;Refresh cache during log in&#8221;</p>

<p>With &#8216;Refresh cache during log in&#8217; enabled the SOLIDWORKS PDM system will perform an automated &#8216;Get&#8217; on all files within folders assigned this setting. This will load the latest version of all files within predetermined folders and also perform a &#8216;get&#8217; on any files within this folder that have previously cached versions already cached.</p>
