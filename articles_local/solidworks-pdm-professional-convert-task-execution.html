<p>Within SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional, when creating a <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2017/06/solidworks-pdm-tasks/">task</a> after selecting <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2013/05/solidworks-pdm-task-host-configuration/">which computers can support the task</a>, we have 3 options for the execution method;</p>
<ol>
<li>Let the system choose the computers to execute the task</li>
<li>Prompt the user to choose a computer when the task is initiated</li>
<li>Execute on the computer where the task is initiated</li>
</ol>

<p>Your environment will define which is the appropriate selection, for example; using a dedicated task host…but what do each of these options mean?</p>
<h4>1. Let the system choose the computers to execute the task</h4>
<p>This option is available if you have multiple task hosts enabled.  With this selected, there is no hierarchy and whichever available machine responds first will accept the task.</p>
<h4>2. Prompt the user to choose a computer when the task is initiated</h4>
<p>With this option selected, when the task is launched, the user will be presented with a list of hosts to choose from;</p>

<blockquote><p>Note: The task will be added to the queue but won’t launch until the client is available</p></blockquote>
<h4>3. Execute on the computer where the task is initiated</h4>
<p>This is the only option available with PDM Standard.  This will launch the task on the same machine that created the task.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’d like the task to be completed silently when attached to a workflow transition, it is required to select <strong><em>Let the system choose the computers to execute the task </em></strong>or <strong><em>Execute on the computer where the task is initiated </em></strong>for the execution method</p></blockquote>
<p>We can monitor what tasks are queued on which machines via the task list in the Administration Tool:</p>
