SOLIDWORKS PDM 2017
Web2 now lets an administrator control download permissions. This is done by modifying the configuration node of the Web.config file.  The Web.config file is located by default, in C:\inetpub\wwwroot\SOLIDWORKSPDM\Web2. The following string denies the user download permissions,
<user
denyDownload
=
“
true
“
name
=
“
No_Soup_For_You
“></user>
The Admin has download permissions enabled by default.
<user
denyDownload
=”
false
“
name
=”
admin
“></user>
These strings are entered under,
<vaultSettings>
, which is found near the end of the Web.config file.
Dynamic Previews
are now supported on Google® Chrome™, Mozilla® Firefox®, and Apple® Safari®, without the need to load any plug-ins.
