When Enterprise PDM is set up to use the Windows Active Directory for user logins, the EPDM users’ passwords will match their Windows passwords.  But what about the special “Admin” user account?  This special account is automatically created for each new vault and cannot be deleted or renamed.
With EPDM set to use the Windows Active Directory, the “Admin” user password cannot be modified in the EPDM Administration Console on the user’s workstations.
To modify the default “Admin” user account password, follow these steps:
1.  Open the Archive Server Configuration tool on the computer running the Enterprise PDM Archive Server.  (If the server is already running then the icon will appear in the taskbar)
2.  In the Archive Server Configuration tool go to Tools and click “Default Settings”.  On the “Login” tab click “Password…”.  Then type the new password into the boxes provided.
This process will modify the default “Admin” user password.  However each individual vault can also have it’s own “Admin” user, with a unique password, if you choose to do so.
To modify an individual vault’s “Admin” user’s password, follow these steps:
1.  Right click on a vault listed in the Archive Server Configuration tool, and select “Properties”
2.  On the “Login” tab of the Properties dialogue, there is the option to “Use default Admin user.”  With this option checked you cannot assign a unique password to the “Admin” user for that vault.  Clearing the checkbox will enable the “Password…” button, allowing you to specify a different password than the default.
These same procedures can be used if the “Admin” user password that was set during the installation, has since been forgotten and needs to be updated.
