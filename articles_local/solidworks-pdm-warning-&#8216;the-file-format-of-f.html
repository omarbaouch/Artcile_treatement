<p>When checking in files that contain configurations, a SOLIDWORKS PDM user may receive a message</p>
<blockquote><p><em>‘The file format of file is not recognized. Do you want to check it in anyway?’</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This may result from the configuration name exceeding 255 characters, which is the maximum allowed in a SOLIDWORKS PDM database.</p>
