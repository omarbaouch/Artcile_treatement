<p>There can be many causes for this.Â  One known cause is attempting to save over the network to a NAS or SANS device while exceeding the disk space allowance.</p>
<p>If this error is only reproducible while attempting to save over the network, the next step would be to contact the IT department to investigate this issue.</p>
