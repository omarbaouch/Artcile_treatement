Why do I receive error “Failed to check proxy settings” when logging in to SOLIDWORKS PDM Web Portal?
When logging in to a SOLIDWORKS PDM vault web portal, an error message displays:
“Failed to check proxy settings.
Description:
The Archive Server could not open the Windows Registry.”
To correct this error message, you can add the site to the Trusted sites in Internet Explorer (IE):
in Internet Explorer go to
Tools
>
Internet Options
>
Security
Tab > select
Trusted sites
> click on the
Sites
button > enter the PDM Vault Web Portal Link and select
Add
to include the link in the list of trusted websites.
Internet Explorer Options
Make sure the option: “Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone” is not checked.
NOTE: This issue can also be caused by having the “IE Enhanced Security Configuration” enabled on the Windows Server operating systems.
