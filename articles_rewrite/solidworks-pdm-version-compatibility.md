<p>Support engineers frequently hear the question: can you upgrade SOLIDWORKS without touching the SOLIDWORKS PDM client? Compatibility depends on whether you run PDM Professional or PDM Standard, and planning ahead prevents service disruptions.</p>

<h2>Supported Versions for SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional</h2>

<p>PDM Professional supports the current SOLIDWORKS release plus the two previous major versions. For example, SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 2016 is validated with SOLIDWORKS 2016, 2015, and 2014. Running anything newer than the server version is unsupported.</p>

<h2>Supported Versions for SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard</h2>

<p>PDM Standard is more restrictive. The client and SOLIDWORKS must share the same major version. While the software might start with an older SOLIDWORKS release, critical tools like Toolbox will not behave correctly, so the configuration is not recommended.</p>

<h2>Mixing Service Packs Within a Release</h2>

<p>You can mix service packs within the same major version. A SOLIDWORKS PDM 2016 SP2 client can connect to SOLIDWORKS 2016 SP4 without issue as long as both belong to the 2016 family.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Best Practices</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Always upgrade SOLIDWORKS PDM before or at the same time as the SOLIDWORKS desktop application.</li>
  <li>Schedule validation testing for Toolbox, custom add-ins, and other integrations after upgrading.</li>
  <li>Avoid scenarios where SOLIDWORKS is a newer major release than the PDM client&mdash;they are explicitly unsupported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Plan your upgrade path around SOLIDWORKS PDM compatibility rules. Keeping the vault client at or ahead of your SOLIDWORKS release ensures that design teams maintain access to the database, automation, and data management features they depend on.</p>
