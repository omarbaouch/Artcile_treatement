Last year when SolidWorks announced it’s Electrical Package, it had every one intrigued with the hope & possibility of unifying the overall design process. After crossing into uncharted territory, it merged the Electrical Schematic world with the Mechanical 3D world and created a robust product. The product seamlessly works with it’s SQL Database for fast real time data management.
A year into the Electrical Product launch and SolidWorks has paid attention to customer requests. They acted and as a result the Electrical Package is at a new level. SolidWorks Electrical 2014 has hundreds of enhancements and I’m sure there will be a lot of happy end users!
