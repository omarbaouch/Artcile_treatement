<p>SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional (formerly called Enterprise PDM) is NOT simple plug and play software. Once the software is deployed within an organization, it must be properly maintained by a qualified SOLIDWORKS PDM Administrator.  This individual is responsible for ensuring all maintenance tasks are properly executed, updating user information, and making configuration changes to the vault.</p>

<h2>New SOLIDWORKS PDM Certification Exam</h2>
<p>In 2012 SOLIDWORKS introduced a new certification exam specifically for PDM Administrators.  The<a href="http://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/27510_ENU_HTML.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> Certified PDM Professional Administrator</a> examination is a challenging 2 hour exam that tests the ability of a PDM Administrator to perform both the common, everyday tasks required to maintain and modify a vault for their organization; as well as their ability to handle potential issues that may crop up.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In my opinion this is one of the best crafted exams I’ve encountered, focusing on very realistic situations that a PDM Administrator will very likely encounter.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>For customers with a current SOLIDWORKS Subscription, this exam is offered for FREE </strong>along with the <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2012/04/free-certification-codes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSWP Offers for Subscription Service Customers</a>.</p>
<h3>Why do you need to get PDM certified?</h3>
<p>SOLIDWORKS Certifications are an industry recognized achievement that shows your ability to use and manage these tools properly.</p>
<p>At present, in Canada, there are only 36 Certified PDM Professional Administrators.  By contrast, there are currently over 2300 Certified SOLIDWORKS Professionals in this country alone – <a href="https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/2015/07/certified-solidworks-user/">learn more about the merits of being a certified user</a>.</p>
