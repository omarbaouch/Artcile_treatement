<p>SolidWorks EPDM templates can be used to generate a document, based on an existing document template. For instance EPDM can use an Excel template to generate an Engineering Change Order (ECO). The template can contain predefined fields, that are either entered manually, or entered by an EPDM variable. In order to prevent the template documents from being accidentally changed, often these templates are placed in a folder where access is limited. When using EPDM templates to generate the ECO, the user who is executing the template must have write access to to the document template. When executing the EPDM template, permission can be assigned so that the user has elevated permissions, when executing the template.</p>

<p>If this option is not set correctly, the user will receive the message. “Could not copy the file. Cause: The file could not be found.”  Please note, this message could also indicate the template file no longer exists in the specified folder, or the template file name contains an invalid character.</p>
