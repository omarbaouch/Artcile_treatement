<p>DS SOLIDWORKS does not officially support the use of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/microsoft-office?rtc=1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft Office 365</a> and similar outsourced mail servers. SOLIDWORKS does provide a Knowledgeable article that offers a possible workaround. This article contains a link to a utility for creating a <a href="http://emailrelay.sourceforge.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">E-MailRelay</a> , as well as a PDF containing general instructions on using this utility.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This utility is not a purpose-built SOLIDWORKS PDM solution and implementing it does require knowledge of email server structures.</p></blockquote>
<p>Implementing the relay is something that should be done by your company IT department. Further, <strong>the use of this utility is not guaranteed by SOLIDWORKS</strong>. It is up to the individual organization to implement and test this solution. Your SOLIDWORKS Value Added Reseller should be able to point you to the Knowledge base article mentioned in this blog.</p>
