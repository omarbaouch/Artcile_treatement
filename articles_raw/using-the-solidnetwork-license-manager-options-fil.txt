Starting with the 2015 release, SOLIDWORKS PDM licensing is now handled through the SolidNetwork License Manager, instead of through a license file.  This has many benefits for PDM administrators, one of which is that it will allow much more customized control over PDM licenses using the SNL Manager Options File.
One such benefit is when it comes to forcing inactive users to log off automatically so that their licenses are released back to the license pool, allowing other users access to PDM.
Previously (in 2014 and older releases) this functionality could be enabled in the Licensing node of the Enterprise PDM Administration console by going to “Automatic Log Off”. However the only option was to have users automatically log off after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Automatic Log Off
Now, for both SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional and SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard this functionality will be controlled by the SolidNetwork License Manager’s time out settings.
This means that by default the automatic log off, or time out, is ENABLED when you upgrade to PDM 2015 or newer software.
The default setting is for inactive licenses to be logged off after 2 hours, however this can be modified using the SNL Manager Options File.
How to create a Custom Options File
Step 1:
Launch the SOLIDWORKS SolidNetWork License Manager program and click “Modify…” on the
Server Administration

Step 5:
Now we write our Options File.  The correct syntax is to have the Option Keyword, followed by a space, then the Feature Name, followed by another space and then the Time in seconds.  For instance if we wanted the PDM Professional CAD Editor licenses to time out after 1 hour of inactivity but the PDM Professional Contributor license to time out after only half an hour we would write:
TIMEOUT swepdm_cadeditorandweb 3600
TIMEOUT swepdm_contributorandweb 1800
Write Options File
A full list of the Option Keywords that can be used in the SNL License file can be found on page 141 and 142 of the FLEXlm End Users Guide (http://files.solidworks.com/Supportfiles/FlexLM_Enduser/licensingenduserguide.pdf).
The Feature Names of the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional products are:
Product Name
Feature Name
CAD Editor
swepdm_cadeditorandweb
Contributor
swepdm_contributorandweb
Viewer
swepdm_viewer
PSL
swepdm_processor
The Feature Names of the SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard products are:
Product Name
Feature Name
CAD Editor
swpdmstd_cadeditor
Contributor
swpdmstd_contributor
Viewer
swpdmstd_viewer
Step 6:
Once the Options File text is finished, save the sw_d.opt file and close it.
