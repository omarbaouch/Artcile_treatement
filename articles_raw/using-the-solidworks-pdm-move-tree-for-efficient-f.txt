Renaming files inside a SOLIDWORKS PDM vault can be intimidating, especially when they’re linked to assemblies, drawings, or other referenced files. Luckily, the Move Tree function in
SOLIDWORKS PDM
offers a safe and efficient way to rename and/or relocate files without breaking references.
In this guide, we’ll explore how to use the Move Tree function to:
Apply structured renaming using Transform operations like Prefix, Suffix, and Replace.
Manually rename files by editing the Target File Name.
Moving files to a different folder while preserving references.
What Is Move Tree in SOLIDWORKS PDM?
The Move Tree command allows users to move or rename files while maintaining all associated references, something that can’t be done safely with basic file system operations like drag-and-drop or
Right-Click>Rename.
To access Move Tree:
Select a file or multiple files inside the PDM Vault.
Choose
Tools>Move
Tree from the context menu.
Automatically Renaming Files in SOLIDWORKS PDM
The transform panel in the Move Tree dialog lets you batch rename files using consistent naming rules. You can perform these actions on a single file, multiple selected files, or all files at one time.
How to Add a Prefix
By adding a prefix using the SOLIDWORKS PDM Move Tree command, you can append a custom string to the beginning of each file name. For example, you can turn a file name from
Path.SLDPRT
to
REV1_Path.SLDPRT
programmatically.
Select the file, click
Add Prefix,
then enter the prefix into the text box.

How to Replace Text
By using the Replace function in the SOLIDWORKS PDM Move Tree command, you can find and replace instances of a string of text within a file name. For example, you can turn a file name from
File Name.SLDPRT
to
File Name_TEST.SLDPRT
programmatically.
Click
Replace
, then enter the desired text in “Find what” and “Replace with” text boxes.

Manually Editing the Target File Name
For more fine control or for situations where the automated methods won’t work, you can manually enter a new file name in the SOLIDWORKS PDM Move Tree command.
To manually edit the target file name:
Launch the Move Tree command.
Select the
Target File Name
of the file(s) you want to rename. Make the desired changes to the file name.
Manually editing the final file name
Confirm the changes in the
Target File Name
cell of the file (s) and click
Move
to finish the operation.
Moving Files to a New Folder
In addition to renaming, you can also move files to a different folder in your PDM Vault without breaking any references. Follow the instructions provided in the article
