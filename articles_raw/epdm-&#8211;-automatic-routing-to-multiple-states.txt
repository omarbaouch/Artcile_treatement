When checking in or transitioning a number of files, you may want to route the files to different states. For instance, you may want to route SolidWorks files to one state and supporting documents to a different state.
In order to make this work, the transition must be set to Automatic and at least one condition must be added to filter which files are allowed into the target state.
In the above example, I used a category to only allow CAD files into the target state, but other conditions or combination of conditions could be used.
