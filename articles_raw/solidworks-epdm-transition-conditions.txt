SOLIDWORKS EPDM Transition Conditions can be added to a workflow transition to limit which files can pass through the transition. As an example, a file can only pass through a workflow if the variable ‘Checked By’ contains an associated value.
A Transition Action
In this example, in a proceeding transition, a user’s initials are mapped to a variable through a transition action.
