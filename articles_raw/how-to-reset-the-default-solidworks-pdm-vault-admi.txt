During the
install of the SOLIDWORKS PDM Archive Server
, you’re prompted to ‘Set the default admin login password’:
SOLIDWORKS PDM Archive Server Configuration
Then when
creating a new vault
, you’re provided options to either set the default password or create a new ‘specific’ SOLIDWORKS PDM Vault Admin Password:
Create New Vault – Use default or set vault specific admin password
If (like in the above screenshot) you opt to create a SOLIDWORKS PDM Vault Admin Password, this can sometimes lead to the default password getting lost or forgotten.  The default password is useful if you ever need to reset a vault specific password, or have multiple vaults and want to keep the password consistent.  In the following article, we’re going to look at how to reset a default password if it is ever lost or forgotten.
How To Reset the Default Admin password
Login to the archive server with local administrative permissions
Open the registry editor
