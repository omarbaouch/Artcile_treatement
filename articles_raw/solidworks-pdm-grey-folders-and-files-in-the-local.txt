On occasion I get asked “why are there
SOLIDWORKS PDM
Grey Folders or files in the Local Vault View?”
A grey folder or file is located in the cache of the Local Vault View
, but is not present in the Archive vault. Here are reasons why grey folders or files would be present in your local vault view:
The folder or file has been deleted, or renamed on a different client
The logged in user lacks the permissions to see the folder or file, but a user with sufficient permissions has previously cached the folder or file locally.
The file was added to the Local Vault view, while in offline mode.
An error occurred while the file was being added to the vault.
The user setting
Show only local files
is checked.
Show only local files
