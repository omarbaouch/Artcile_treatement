Navigating large assembly reference trees within SOLIDWORKS PDM can be difficult, especially when Checking a file In/Out, performing a Copy Tree function, or Changing States.
Let’s look at the dialog box when checking out a file:
Check Out Assembly
When checking out a file, the dialog box above is the default dialog box that is seen, however, if I had wanted to select all of the references for one of the sub assemblies, I’d need to select them individually.
However, with a slight modification, all you will need to do is select one checkbox to select ALL of its referenced components…. See below:
Check Out Dialog Box Commands
The Show All Levels/Top Level Only dropdown above allows you to expand/collapse your reference tree in the dialog box
The
Show Reference Selection Controls
toggle turns on a parallel set of check boxes that will allow you to select or clear all check boxes from that one node. So if I only want to check out one sub-assembly and its parts from the Top level assembly, I can do so using the parallel check box. To access this toggle, Right click on any file listed and select ‘
Show Reference Selection Control
‘
The same commands can be applied when the file is being checked out or used in the copy tree functionality.
