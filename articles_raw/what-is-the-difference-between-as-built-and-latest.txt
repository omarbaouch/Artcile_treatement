The dividing factor between SOLIDWORKS PDM As-Built vs Latest in a Bill of Materials is a
Check-in
of the selected assembly
.
As-Built vs Latest
The
As Built
option will show the BOM for a referenced file at the time that the assembly is checked in whereas the
Latest
option shows the BOM for a referenced assembly, which reflects the latest versions of all referenced files.
If you check out an assembly, make a change, and then check the assembly back into the vault — PDM will update the referenced BOM to reflect the latest changes.
Confused?  Me too, let’s look at an example.
As-built vs latest
I’ve got an assembly I created
ParentAssem.SLDASM
then added a sub-assembly
SubAssem.SLDASM
(which contains SubAssemPart.SLDPRT)  to it and checked it in (version 1).
SOLIDWORKS Assembly Checked In
Then I modified SubAssem to add a new part within it SubAssemNewPart.SLDPRT.  Notice SubAssem.SLDASM goes to version 2.
Assembly revised as version 2
Now let’s look at the difference between the As-Built and Latest
ParentAssem.SLDASM.
First

Next

Latest Assembly
Notice that SubAssemNewPart.SLDPRT appears in
Latest
because it was added after
ParentAssem
was checked in.
