The SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integral component for administrating SOLIDWORKS PDM, as it allows us to maintain and capture backups of the database.  When installing a new instance of SQL Express for PDM Standard via the installation manager, the management studio is not included and requires a
separate download and install
.  In this article, we’re going to look at how to install a new instance of SQL and include the SSMS, ahead of installing PDM Standard.
