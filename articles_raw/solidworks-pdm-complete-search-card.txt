‘Out of the box’ SOLIDWORKS PDM contains a
Complete Search Card
that has many options for search criteria.  For example; Users can search by filename, description, current state, or even so far as text contained inside a document using the “Content” tab.  Basically; this form has an option for pretty much any value you may be looking for within the vault.
Some users may find this card overwhelming, therefore it can be a good idea to modify this card to make it more suited for the company’s needs.  If you’d like to make changes but leave the original intact you can import it and save it as a different name.
