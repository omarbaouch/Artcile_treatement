Sometimes the archive log file is not enough to troubleshoot your vault – the “
Collect Support Information…
” tool allows you to quickly generate a variety of logs and reports.
STEP 1:
In the SolidWorks Enterprise PDM Administration Window, right-click on the vault and click on Collect Support Information…
STEP 2:
Choose the information to be generated.
STEP 3:
Add any files or folders from the Archive, if required.
STEP 4:
If needed or requested, create a back-up of the SQL database.
STEP 5:
Enter any additional information that you feel is important.
STEP 6:
Create the package.
STEP 7:
Send the resulting zip file to the support help desk of your local SolidWorks reseller.
