<p>After upgrading SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional, Web2 may stall at login, loop back to the sign-in page, or display a <em>Could not open database</em> error. The common culprit is the IIS application pool reverting to the default <strong>Network Service</strong> account.</p>

<h2>Confirm the Correct Service Account</h2>

<p>Web2 requires a Windows account that has logged into the vault, selected at least one folder, and belongs to both the <strong>IIS_IUSRS</strong> and local <strong>Administrators</strong> groups. If the identity changes during an upgrade, Web2 loses access.</p>

<h2>Update the Application Pool Identity</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open <strong>Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager</strong>, select <strong>Application Pools</strong>, highlight <strong>SOLIDWORKS PDM Web2</strong>, and choose <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
  <li>In the Advanced Settings dialog, click the <strong>Identity</strong> field and then the browse button (<strong>â€¦</strong>).</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<h2>Verify Access</h2>

<p>Recycle the SOLIDWORKS PDM Web2 application pool and sign in again. The proper identity restores navigation, folder browsing, and file viewing across your SOLIDWORKS PDM data management environment.</p>
