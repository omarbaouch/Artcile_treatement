Drawings do not have sheet specific custom properties and because of this, in the SOLIDWORKS PDM Data Card,  their properties always appear under the
@
tab.
SOLIDWORKS PDM Tabs
This can result in the @ tab and Sheet(s) tab(s) displaying differing information.
Different Info Displayed
We can use the option
Update all configurations
in file data card, to ensure that sheet tabs and the @ tab show the same information, but this is not always the goal.
Update all configurations
We may want to pull information, such as title-block information, that is unique to each Sheet and display it on the corresponding sheet tab, of the drawings data card. At the time this article was written, this is
NOT
possible. The problem stems from the fact, that sheets are not configurations. While in a part or assembly, we can access configuration specific properties, there is no such thing as sheet specific properties.
