By default, the SOLIDWORKS PDM client is set to use server name, which via
DNS lookup
will resolve the IP number and communicate with the server.  In a perfect world, the DNS server configuration will resolve quickly and not cause any issues, but this isn’t always possible in certain environments, for example, while using a VPN.
Slow lookup may result in the following symptoms within PDM:
Delay when logging in
General poor performance while navigating or adding files
Replication Failing
Occasionally a PDM support technician may advise you to bypass the DNS lookup, by editing the local HOSTS file and adding the server IP.
NOTE
: Users should always consult their local IT Professional ahead of making any of these changes
How to edit the local hosts file and add the server IP
NOTE
:
Local Windows Administrator credentials are required
Using the Administrator account run Notepad;
Run Notepad
File
>
Open
Change the setting to look for
All Files
(defaults to *.txt)
Navigate to and
Open
the
hosts
file;
HOSTS File Location
Default location is C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc\
Underneath the comment section (any line that begins with #) add a new line for each required server with the IP Number and the server name and a tab space in between.  For example;
192.168.1.xxx     MyDbServerName
192.168.1.xxx     MyArchiveServerName
Hosts File
NOTE
: If the archive and the DB server are hosted on the same machine, only one line is required.
Save and close the hosts file.
Once complete, the DNS lookup should be bypassed and the hostname resolved directly using the IP.  Once complete, I would recommend running the
connectivity tool
to ensure the connection works as expected, or complete a
ping test
.
