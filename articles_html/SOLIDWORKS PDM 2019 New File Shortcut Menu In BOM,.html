<p>In previous releases of SOLIDWORKS PDM, when right clicking on any referenced file on the Bill of Materials, Contains or Where Used Tabs wouldn&#8217;t give access to the full File Shortcut menu.</p>
<p>Instead, users had to go through two steps, first going directly to that file using the &#8220;Browse to&#8221; or &#8220;Browse to in a New Window&#8221;  command, then right clicking on the file in the Vault View window to access the File Shortcut Menu to perform actions such as checking out the file or performing a transition.</p>
<p>Now in SOLIDWORKS PDM 2019, users have access to the full File Shortcut Menu directly in these tabs.</p>
