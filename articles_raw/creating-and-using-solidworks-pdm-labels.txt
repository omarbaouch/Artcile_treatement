SOLIDWORKS PDM Labels are used to add a note to a version of a file. Once added, Labels can be used in searches, as well as adding information to a file’s History. Labels in many ways perform the same functions as Version Comments, but unlike a version comment, a Label can be added without creating a new version.
To add a Label, in the SOLIDWORKS PDM Local Vault View, select one or more files, or select folder(s).
Next from the Modify pull-down select Label.
Modify Label
In the dialog box, enter a Name for the Label. Optionally, a Comment can be added.
